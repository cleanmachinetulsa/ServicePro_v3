[12/11/2025, 12:21:53 AM] THEM: Nice, those points do come in handy 😄  

Text me:
1) What you want done (Full Detail, Interior, Wash, Ceramic, etc.)  
2) Vehicle year/make/model  

I’ll ballpark the price and how much your 500 pts knock off.
[12/11/2025, 12:22:12 AM] THEM: Nice, glad you got the points text 😄  

Shoot me:
1) The service you’re thinking (Full Detail, Interior Detail, Premium Wash, Ceramic, etc.)  
2) Your vehicle year/make/model  

I’ll ballpark your total and how much the 500 pts will knock off.
[12/11/2025, 12:22:23 AM] THEM: Nice, glad that helped 😄  

Shoot me:
1) The service you’re leaning toward  
2) Your vehicle year/make/model  

I’ll give you a price range and how much 500 pts knocks off.
[12/11/2025, 12:22:34 AM] THEM: Nice, love that! 😄  

Go ahead and tell me:
1) Which service you’re thinking (Full Detail, Interior Detail, Premium Wash, etc.)
2) Your vehicle year/make/model  

I’ll ballpark the total and show what 500 points would knock off.
[12/11/2025, 12:22:45 AM] THEM: Nice! 😄  

To use that 500-point credit, here’s a quick idea of savings:
- On a $150 Interior Detail: 500 pts = about $25 off  
- On a $250 Full Detail: 500 pts = about $40–50 off  

Shoot me:
1) The service you’re leaning toward (Interior, Full Detail, etc.)  
2) Year/make/model  

I’ll give you a more exact price range and your discount.
[12/11/2025, 12:22:56 AM] THEM: Nice, that 500 pts will definitely help 😄  

What are you thinking:
- Interior Detail (deep inside clean)  
- Full Detail (inside + outside)  
- Or just a specific thing (shampoo, pet hair, etc.)?  

And what’s your vehicle year/make/model? I’ll ballpark your total after your points.
[12/11/2025, 12:23:07 AM] THEM: Love it 😄 those 500 pts will definitely help.

To ballpark it for you, I just need:
1) What service you’re leaning toward (Interior Detail, Full Detail, or something specific)?
2) Your vehicle year/make/model?
[12/11/2025, 12:23:16 AM] THEM: Love it 😄 those “points” are basically your savings on future details.

Quick stuff I need from you:
1) Which service are you thinking? (Interior Detail, Full Detail, or something else?)
2) Year/make/model of your vehicle?

I’ll give you a price range and we can go from there.
