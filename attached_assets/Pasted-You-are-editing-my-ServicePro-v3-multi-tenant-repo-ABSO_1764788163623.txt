You are editing my ServicePro v3 multi-tenant repo.

ABSOLUTE RULES (DO NOT IGNORE):

1. DO NOT wander or refactor large files unless explicitly asked.
   - Make the smallest change that solves the problem.
   - If you find multiple issues, FIX THE ONE I ASKED ABOUT FIRST.

2. For any UX / behavior change:
   - AFTER your changes, you MUST:
     - Restart the dev server if needed.
     - Open the relevant page or flow in the dev preview.
     - MANUALLY TEST the exact thing I’m complaining about.
   - If the behavior is STILL BROKEN:
     - SAY SO in your summary.
     - DO NOT claim “it should work now.”

3. Minimize expensive loops:
   - Avoid repeatedly editing the same file 10+ times in one run.

4. When you finish:
   - Summarize EXACTLY what you changed (files + main behaviors).
   - Tell me how you tested it and what you observed.

TASK:

1. Find ALL Twilio Voice / IVR handlers in this repo. Look for:
   - Express routes like /api/twilio/voice, /api/twilio/ivr, /voice/ivr, etc.
   - Any TwiML generation using new twilio.twiml.VoiceResponse().
   - Any mention of "press 1", "press 2", "IVR" in the server code or docs.

2. Identify WHERE the logic for handling the caller’s DTMF choice (Digits) is implemented.

3. Modify ONLY the handler that maps to the current production IVR “main menu” so that:
   - When the caller presses "2", Twilio DIALS my SIP URI:
     sip:jody@cleanmacinetulsa.sip.twilio.com

   Implementation requirement:
   - Use Twilio’s VoiceResponse and:
       twiml.dial().sip("sip:jody@cleanmacinetulsa.sip.twilio.com");
   - Keep all existing options for other digits (1, 3, etc.) working as they are.

4. If the SIP URI is currently pointing to something else (like my cell), REPLACE that target with the SIP URI above.

5. In your summary, tell me:
   - The exact file and function you changed.
   - The TwiML you now output for digit "2".
   - Any environment variables or Twilio Console settings I must verify for this to work
     (e.g. which route/url must be set as the Voice webhook on my main Twilio number).

DO NOT touch SMS handlers, AI logic, or unrelated files.
Focus ONLY on the IVR → SIP path for “press 2 to talk to someone”.
