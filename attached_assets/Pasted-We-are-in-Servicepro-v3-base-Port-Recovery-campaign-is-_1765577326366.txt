We are in Servicepro-v3-base. Port Recovery campaign is failing. Logs show:
"Error awarding points: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'points')"
Stack mentions:

awardCampaignPointsOnce(...)
grantPortRecoveryPoints(...)
awardPoints(...)

Goal: FIX IN MINUTES. Make Port Recovery sending FAIL-OPEN like booking stats:
- Points awarding must NEVER prevent SMS sending.
- If points config is missing/undefined, skip points, log, continue.
- Ensure SMS sending actually happens and is logged.

Tasks:
1) Locate the port recovery batch runner (likely server-side service/route that handles /admin/port-recovery Send Next 50 / Send All).
2) Identify the exact "award points" call that throws due to reading `.points` of undefined.
   - Add defensive guards: if campaign or config or customer record is missing points settings, set pointsToAward = 0 and continue.
   - Wrap points awarding in try/catch that never throws, log as:
     [PORT RECOVERY] points_award_failed customerId=... phone=... err=...
3) Reorder the flow so SMS send is attempted even if points fail:
   - Preferred order: (a) Render + send SMS, (b) award points (best-effort), (c) mark recipient status.
   - If you cannot reorder quickly, at least ensure an exception in points step does not abort the loop.
4) Add a high-signal log line per recipient:
   [PORT RECOVERY] recipient phone=... customerId=... sms_attempted=true sms_ok=true/false points_attempted=true points_ok=true/false
5) Ensure the UI counters reflect partial success:
   - If SMS succeeds but points fails, mark as "sent_with_points_error" (or still "sent" but record points error).
6) After patch: run one single-recipient path (use existing Test SMS or temporarily add a CLI function) and show logs proving:
   - Twilio messages.create called
   - SID returned
   - Loop continues even if points errors

Constraints:
- Do NOT touch unrelated schema.
- Do NOT require drizzle-kit push.
- Minimal changes, surgical.
Return: list of files changed + exact what to click to test + expected log output.
