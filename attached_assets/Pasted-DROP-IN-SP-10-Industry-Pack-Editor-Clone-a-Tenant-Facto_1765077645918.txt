DROP-IN: SP-10 – Industry Pack Editor + Clone-a-Tenant Factory

Goal: Give you (root admin) a way to maintain industry packs (services/FAQs/AI rules) and clone existing tenants as templates, so onboarding for new industries is fast and consistent.

Prompt for Replit agent:

You are editing ServicePro_v3.
Implement SP-10 – Industry Pack Editor + Clone-a-Tenant Factory.
Use the existing industry pack system that powers the onboarding flow.

1. Industry packs data model (if not already normalized)

Inspect how industry packs are currently represented:

They may be in a TS config (e.g. shared/industryPacks.ts).

They may be partially in DB (services, FAQs seeded by industry).

Introduce a DB representation if needed:

industry_packs:

id (string key, e.g. 'auto_detailing')

name

description

isDefault

industry_pack_services

industry_pack_faqs

industry_pack_ai_rules

etc., matching whatever is currently in the TS config.

Add a simple one-time migration script to sync existing TS configs → DB so current packs are editable.

2. Root admin UI – Industry Pack Editor

Add a new root-admin-only page, e.g. /admin/industry-packs.

Features:

Left sidebar: list of packs (Auto Detailing, Lawn Care, House Cleaning, etc.).

Main panel with tabs:

“Overview”: name, description, default flags.

“Services”: list/add/edit services (name, category, default price, duration).

“FAQs”: list/add/edit FAQs (question, answer, tags).

“AI Behavior”: textarea or structured fields for AI instructions specific to this industry.

Changes should update the DB tables, not the TS config.

When onboarding uses industry packs, it should now pull from DB, with TS config only as a fallback.

3. Clone-a-Tenant Factory

Implement a backend service, e.g. tenantCloneService.ts, that can:

Given a source tenant ID:

Read core configuration:

Services

Pricing / add-ons

Public site settings

Telephony config (excluding PIIs like numbers if not reusable)

AI behavior rules

Create a new industry pack or pack variant from that.

Add a root admin UI card on a tenant admin page (/admin/tenants/:id):

Button: “Create Industry Pack from This Tenant”.

Lets you:

Enter a new industry pack ID + name.

Confirm which categories to include (services, FAQs, AI rules, site content).

After confirmation, the system populates the industry pack tables with this tenant’s config.

4. Onboarding integration

Update the industry selection step in the onboarding flow:

It should read from industry_packs DB.

Show human-friendly names and optional descriptions/badges.

When an industry is selected:

Bootstrap tenant data from the chosen pack using the DB definitions.

5. Safety & multi-tenant isolation

Only root admins can:

Edit industry packs.

Create packs from tenants.

Regular tenants can benefit from packs during onboarding, but cannot see or edit the global library.

6. Tests & docs

Add basic tests:

Editing an industry pack updates the values used in onboarding.

Cloning from a tenant creates a new pack with expected content.
