You are the Replit Agent working on the `ServicePro_v3` repo.

DO NOT modify any code in this task.

Goal:
Produce a clear, structured “navigation map” of the current dashboard sidebar and top-level routes so an external AI can analyze the layout and suggest improvements.

Steps:

1️⃣ Find the navigation source

- Locate the file(s) that define the sidebar / app navigation items. Likely candidates:
  - `client/src/config/navigationItems.ts` or similar,
  - or any layout components like `Sidebar.tsx`, `AppShell.tsx`, etc. that hard-code nav items.
- Also note any special cases:
  - Items that are conditionally rendered based on plan/tier.
  - Items hidden behind “owner only” or “admin only” flags.

2️⃣ Build a structured JSON map

From what you find, build a single JSON object with this shape:

{
  "navTree": [
    {
      "sectionLabel": "string or null",   // e.g. "Main", "Settings & Administration", etc. If not grouped, use null.
      "items": [
        {
          "label": "Messages",
          "path": "/messages",
          "iconName": "MessageCircle" | null,
          "categoryGuess": "core" | "marketing" | "settings" | "billing" | "support" | "other",
          "isOwnerOnly": true | false | "unknown",
          "tierRestrictions": "all" | "paid_only" | "higher_tiers_only" | "unknown",
          "isCustomerFacingConfig": true | false | "unknown"
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Any comments that will help another AI understand oddities or special cases."
  ]
}

Requirements:

- For each nav item / sidebar link:
  - Include the **label shown to the user**.
  - Include the **route path** (e.g. `/settings/email`, `/admin/support-tickets`).
  - Include the **icon component name** if available.
  - Make your best guess for `categoryGuess` based on the path/label.
- If the code uses nested groups or sections, reflect that in `sectionLabel`.
- If there is a “top nav” separate from “sidebar nav”, include a separate section with `sectionLabel: "topNav"`.

3️⃣ Output

- Print ONLY:
  - A short header explaining which file(s) you inspected.
  - The JSON object as described above, properly formatted.
- Do not include TypeScript types or full source code; just the summarized JSON and any relevant notes in the `notes` section.

Again: DO NOT change any files. This is a read-only mapping task so another AI can redesign the nav later.
