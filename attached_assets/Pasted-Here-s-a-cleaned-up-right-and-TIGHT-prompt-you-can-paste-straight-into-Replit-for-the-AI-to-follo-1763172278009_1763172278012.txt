Here’s a cleaned-up, “right and TIGHT” prompt you can paste straight into Replit for the AI to follow:


---

You are Replit’s AI coding assistant working inside my existing full-stack web app project (dashboard + messaging hub + PWA that replaces Google Voice for my business communications).

Your job right now is to stabilize, complete, and polish the app toward production-ready, AAA-level quality. Follow every instruction below carefully, and explain what you changed as you go.


---

HIGH-LEVEL GOALS

Make the app stable (no white screens, no broken routes).

Ensure all core components are actually integrated into the real flows (not just created in isolation).

Clean up confusing UX (especially settings / configuration areas).

Prepare the app to be deployable for real customers once code is solid.

TASK 1 — PAYMENT CODE SNIPPET / AUTOMATION

1. There is supposed to be a code snippet that can be added to any payment page (likely related to invoices / referral codes / tracking).


2. Your tasks:

Locate any existing code snippet you previously added or started for this purpose.

If it already exists:

Refactor it into a reusable component / hook / function that can be easily attached to any payment page.

Wire it into all current payment / checkout / invoice pages where it’s supposed to be used.


If it does not exist or is incomplete:

Design and implement a sensible, reusable solution that:

Is easy for a non-developer (me) to reuse.

Has clear comments on where and how to call it.





3. When you’re done:

Document exactly which files contain this snippet.

Show me how to add it to any new payment page in 2–3 simple steps.




I do not have the technical skills to wire this in manually, so assume you must do the full integration and leave me only simple “copy/paste or import + 1 line” usage.


---

TASK 2 — AI BIO HELPER TOOL (SMS TEMPLATES PAGE)

There is an AI bio helper tool on the SMS templates page.

1. Confirm whether this tool is pre-contextualized with hard-coded context (e.g., my business, tone of voice, example bios, etc.).


2. If it isn’t:

Add a clear, sensible hard-coded context block that:

Explains that this is for my business SMS templates.

Sets tone (professional but friendly, trustworthy, local service owner).

Includes any necessary fields / variables (name, role, experience, specialties).




3. Make sure:

The user experience is clear (labels, helper text).

Any AI calls are safe, predictable, and easy to adjust later.




Explain in your summary how you contextualized it and where that context lives in the code.


---

TASK 3 — DASHBOARD SEARCH BAR: LIVE VALIDATION & SUGGESTIONS

On the main dashboard page, there is a search bar at the top.

I want this to behave more like Google’s search box:

1. Add live validation + live suggestions:

As the user types, show a dropdown with:

Matching settings.

Matching components/pages.

Possibly common actions (e.g., “Go to Messages”, “Open Billing Settings”, etc.) if you can map them.




2. Implementation details:

Use a debounced input so we don’t over-render.

Suggest results in a dropdown panel directly under the search bar.

Clicking a result should navigate to the relevant page or surface that setting (or at least set up the navigation hook for that).



3. UX requirements:

Keyboard navigation (↑/↓/Enter) should work nicely if feasible.

Empty state: e.g., “Start typing to search settings and sections…”

No janky layout shifts or weird overlapped UI.




If any part of this is ambiguous, make a best-effort, robust implementation and then describe your design in the summary so I can refine later.


---

TASK 4 — WHITE SCREEN BUGS & InvoiceReferralCodeInput PAGE

There is a new page: InvoiceReferralCodeInput.

Right now it shows a white screen. This is part of a bigger pattern: new pages you create or edit tend to go white screen.

Your job:

1. Diagnose and fix the InvoiceReferralCodeInput page:

Find the exact cause of the white screen (routing, layout wrapper, missing provider, runtime error, etc.).

Fix it so the page loads properly and is reachable from whatever route / navigation is intended.



2. General white screen prevention:

Identify whether this is a wrapper/layout/provider issue, route config issue, or something else.

Add appropriate guards / error boundaries / layout consistency so:

New pages don’t silently white screen.

Errors surface in a clear dev-friendly way (e.g., error boundary message or console error).




3. Bake the fix into your building logic:

Standardize page creation:

Which layout component to wrap with.

Which providers / contexts are required.

How routes should be declared.


Refactor existing pages if necessary so the pattern is consistent.



4. Confirm at the end:

No pages are currently white screening.

You have a repeatable pattern for adding new pages without breaking the app.





---

TASK 5 — 22-POINT TASK LIST & DATABASE SCHEMA

Previously you had a 22-point task list plus older smaller task lists.

1. Locate that 22-point list (and any earlier to-do/task lists in the code or comments).


2. For each item:

Mark it as:

✅ Completed, or

⏳ Still needed (and then complete it now, if it’s still relevant).




3. Do the same for any older task lists that are still relevant.


4. Confirm that the database schema is:

Synchronized with the ORM / migrations.

Working properly end to end across:

Dashboard

Messages

Any other key pages (billing, templates, etc.).




5. After schema verification:

Ensure the app is deploy-ready:

No obvious breaking migrations.

No hard-coded dev URLs that would break in production.


If additional steps are needed to deploy, list them clearly in your summary.





---

TASK 6 — SETTINGS UX (MESSAGES PAGE VS DASHBOARD)

Currently there are two settings menus on the Messages page, plus another more complex settings menu in the main Dashboard.

The Messages page functions as my business messaging + phone communications hub and is used via a PWA app on my home screen, replacing Google Voice (dialer, messaging, visual voicemail, etc.).

Your job:

1. Analyze the current settings structure:

Identify all places where there are settings menus/buttons, especially:

Messages page.

Global dashboard.




2. Decide on a best-practice layout:

If appropriate, consolidate everything under:

A single, global settings area with clearly separated sections, or

A global settings area + a small, local settings section for the Messages page that is truly specific to messaging.


Reduce redundancy and confusion.



3. Implementation:

Refactor the UI so users clearly understand:

Where to go for global/settings vs messages-specific settings.


Update labels, icons, and navigation to match this new structure.



4. If you’re unsure of best practice:

Use your knowledge of common messaging/phone UIs (Google Voice, iMessage, WhatsApp, etc.).

If your environment allows, search for best practices around “messaging app settings vs global settings” and use that to guide your design.




Explain in the summary what you changed and how to access each settings area now.


---

TASK 7 — COMPONENT INTEGRATION & OUTDATED PAGES

I’m concerned there are components you created but never fully integrated into the app flows.

Your job:

1. Search the codebase for:

Components or pages that were created but are not imported/used anywhere.

“Dead” or legacy UI that’s no longer wired into navigation.



2. For each such component/page:

Decide if it should:

Be properly integrated into the current UX, or

Be removed/retired to reduce clutter and confusion.




3. Additionally:

Scan for older pages or elements that have not been upgraded to match the current stack configuration (e.g., old layout patterns, missing providers, outdated styling, old routing patterns).

Update them to the modern, current pattern you’re using elsewhere so the whole app feels consistent.



4. Make sure:

There are no important features/components that are only half-wired.

The navigation structure makes sense from a real user perspective.




In your summary, list:

Components/pages that were previously unused and what you did with them.

Any significant legacy pieces you modernized.



---

TASK 8 — FINAL POLISH & UX QUALITY

As you implement all of the above, also:

1. Push for AAA-level, top-tier production quality:

Smooth, consistent animated transitions.

No weird “window inside a window” UI unless explicitly intended.

Back and Cancel buttons work everywhere it’s expected:

They navigate sensibly or close dialogs/sheets without trapping the user.




2. Ensure:

No major layout jank between pages.

Mobile/PWA experience is solid (especially for Messages & dashboard).



3. Make reasonable improvements if you see obvious rough edges.




---

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

When you’re done (or at logical checkpoints), provide:

1. A clear summary of:

Changes made for each task (1–8).

Files and key components you touched.



2. Any remaining TODOs that absolutely require my input (e.g., business copy, complex product decisions).


3. Short usage notes where relevant (e.g., “To use the payment snippet on a new page, do X, Y, Z”).



Do not just say “done” — I need enough detail to understand:

What was fixed,

What changed structurally,

And how to use any new tools/components you built.



---

Use your full capabilities, write clean, maintainable code, and assume I am not a programmer — you must handle the technical parts end-to-end and leave me with simple, documented hooks and usage steps.
