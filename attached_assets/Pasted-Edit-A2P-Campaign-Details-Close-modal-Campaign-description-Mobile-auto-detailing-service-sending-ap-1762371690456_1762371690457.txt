How do end-users consent to receive messages? (40-2048 characters)
Customers provide SMS consent through multiple methods:

1. ONLINE BOOKING: Customers booking at cleanmachinetulsa.com/sms-consent must check a consent checkbox agreeing to receive appointment confirmations, reminders, and updates. We record consent timestamp and IP address.

2. PHONE BOOKINGS: When customers book by phone, we ask "Can I send you text confirmations and reminders?" and document their verbal "yes" consent in our system before sending any SMS.

3. INBOUND TEXTS: When customers text our business number first, we reply to their inquiry. Their initial text message constitutes consent for that conversation.

4. MISSED CALL RESPONSE: When a customer calls and we miss it, we send ONE automated informational SMS: "Sorry we missed your call! Please call back or text us to schedule." This is a one-time courtesy message with opt-out instructions. No further messages are sent unless they respond or book an appointment with explicit consent.

All messages include STOP opt-out instructions.
This field should describe how end users opt-in to the campaign, therefore giving consent to the sender to receive their messages. If multiple opt-in methods can be used for the same campaign, they must all be listed.
