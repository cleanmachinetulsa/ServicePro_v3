How do end-users consent to receive messages? (40-2048 characters)
Customers consent through our online booking system at https://cleanmachinetulsa.com/sms-consent

When booking an appointment, customers must check a consent checkbox stating: "I Consent to Receive Informational messages & Alerts from Clean Machine Auto Detail. Message frequency varies. Message & data rates may apply. You can reply STOP to unsubscribe at any time."

The consent form includes:
- Explicit checkbox with opt-in language
- Phone number field where customers enter their contact information
- Timestamp and IP address logging for audit compliance
- Clear STOP opt-out instructions

All messages include STOP opt-out instructions. We never send unsolicited marketing to numbers that only consented to appointment communications.
