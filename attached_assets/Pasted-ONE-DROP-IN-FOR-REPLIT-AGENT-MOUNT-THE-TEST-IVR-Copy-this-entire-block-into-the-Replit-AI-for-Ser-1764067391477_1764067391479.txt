ONE DROP-IN FOR REPLIT AGENT (MOUNT THE TEST IVR)

Copy this entire block into the Replit AI for Servicepro-v3-base:

You are editing the Servicepro-v3-base repo.

Goal:
Wire up the existing test IVR router so that:
- /api/twilio/voice/inbound, /handle-key, /voicemail-complete actually exist
- WITHOUT touching the existing production twilioVoiceRouter mounted at /twilio.

We only want to:
- Import twilioTestVoiceRouter (the test IVR you already created)
- Mount it under /api/twilio/voice in server/index.ts
- Leave everything else exactly as-is.

==================================================
STEP 1 – Import the test voice router in server/index.ts
==================================================

1. Open server/index.ts.

2. At the top where other routes are imported, you already have:

```ts
import sendgridWebhookRouter from "./routes.sendgridWebhook";
import twilioVoiceRouter from "./routes.twilioVoice";
import campaignsRouter from "./routes.campaigns";


Right AFTER the twilioVoiceRouter import, add this line:

import { twilioTestVoiceRouter } from "./routes/twilioTestVoice";


(If the file path is slightly different, use the correct path to the test IVR router file you created earlier.)

==================================================
STEP 2 – Mount the test IVR router

In the async IIFE near the bottom of server/index.ts, you already have:

  // Register phone settings routes (phone line configuration)
  app.use('/api/phone-settings', phoneSettingsRouter);

  // Register Twilio Voice webhook (handles incoming calls to business number)
  app.use('/twilio', twilioVoiceRouter);

  // Run startup health checks for external services
  await runStartupHealthChecks();


RIGHT AFTER the line that mounts twilioVoiceRouter, insert:

  // Register Twilio TEST Voice webhook (handles IVR for test number)
  app.use('/api/twilio/voice', twilioTestVoiceRouter);


The final block should look like:

  // Register phone settings routes (phone line configuration)
  app.use('/api/phone-settings', phoneSettingsRouter);

  // Register Twilio Voice webhook (handles incoming calls to business number)
  app.use('/twilio', twilioVoiceRouter);

  // Register Twilio TEST Voice webhook (handles IVR for test number)
  app.use('/api/twilio/voice', twilioTestVoiceRouter);

  // Run startup health checks for external services
  await runStartupHealthChecks();


Do NOT change anything else in this file.
