Nice, yes—an interactive sandbox is exactly the kind of flex this page deserves.

Here’s an add-on prompt you can paste into Replit after (or alongside) the first mega-prompt. It tells Ghostwriter to build a full “Live Sandbox” / “Try the Agent” environment inside the showcase.

⸻


### ADD-ON REQUIREMENT: INTERACTIVE "LIVE SANDBOX" AGENT EXPERIENCE

In addition to everything already specified for the Clean Machine showcase page, I want a **highly interactive sandbox section** where visitors can **try the agent**, see **simulated SMS-style conversations**, and watch **automations and alerts fire in real time**.

This is NOT connected to production infrastructure – it’s a **front-end simulation** that:
- Feels like a real conversation with the Clean Machine agent.
- Shows what happens "under the hood" as the agent triggers automations.
- Lets visitors run **preset scenarios** (like “New lead inquiry”, “Rain reschedule”, “Follow-up reminder”, etc).

---

## NEW SECTION: LIVE SANDBOX / TRY THE AGENT

Create a new section in the showcase page:

- ID: `#sandbox`
- Title: “Try the Clean Machine Agent”
- Add this section to the sticky nav so users can jump straight to it.

This section should have **three key parts**:

1. **Mode & Scenario Selector (top bar / left side)**
2. **Chat Simulator (primary focus)**
3. **Automation Timeline / Under-the-Hood View (right side or bottom)**

---

### 1. MODE & SCENARIO SELECTOR

At the top of the sandbox section, include:

- **Mode tabs** (pills):
  - “Free Play”
  - “New Lead → Booking”
  - “Rain Reschedule”
  - “Follow-Up & Reviews”
  - “Upsell & Packages”

When a user clicks a mode:

- It loads:
  - A **preset starting conversation** (if scenario-based).
  - A default “system state” for the automations.
- It also updates a short description of what they’re about to experience.

Visuals / UX:

- Use pill-style buttons with smooth animated underline/indicator.
- Show a 1–2 sentence description under the tabs:
  - Example: “New Lead → Booking: Experience how Clean Machine greets a new customer, checks their location, and locks in a time slot—all over SMS.”

---

### 2. CHAT SIMULATOR (CORE INTERACTIVE PIECE)

This is the main “wow” area.

Implement a **chat-style interface** that looks like a modern messaging app:

- Left/right bubbles for:
  - **Customer** messages (visitor input).
  - **Clean Machine Agent** replies (simulated).
- A chat input at the bottom:
  - Text field
  - “Send” button
  - (Optional) quick suggestion chips above the input for people who don’t know what to type.

Important:

- This sandbox does **NOT** need real AI. Instead:
  - Use front-end logic and a **small state machine** to produce **plausible, helpful replies**, based on:
    - Current mode (“New Lead”, “Rain”, etc.).
    - Keywords in the visitor’s message (e.g. “tomorrow”, “rain”, “outside area”).
    - A basic conversation state (e.g. “collecting address”, “offering times”, “confirming appointment”).

Implement a very simple rule engine for the sandbox:

- Example shape:

```ts
type SandboxMode =
  | "free-play"
  | "new-lead"
  | "rain"
  | "follow-up"
  | "upsell";

type ConversationStep =
  | "greeting"
  | "collecting_name"
  | "collecting_address"
  | "checking_service_area"
  | "offering_slots"
  | "confirming_booking"
  | "post_job_followup"
  | "review_request"
  | "upsell_offer"
  | "complete";

interface SandboxState {
  mode: SandboxMode;
  step: ConversationStep;
  messages: Array<{
    id: string;
    from: "customer" | "agent";
    text: string;
    timestamp: number;
  }>;
}

	•	Create a small function like generateAgentReply(state, customerMessage) -> { replyText: string; nextState: SandboxState; triggeredEvents: AutomationEvent[] }.
	•	AutomationEvent will be used in the automation timeline (see below).

Design:
	•	Chat window sits in a glassmorphism card with subtle glow.
	•	Scrollable chat area with custom scrollbar styling.
	•	Typing indicator animation when agent “thinks” (short artificial delay).

⸻

3. AUTOMATION TIMELINE / UNDER-THE-HOOD VIEW

Next to, or beneath, the chat (depending on screen width), show a live-updating timeline of automations:
	•	When the agent sends a message, or when certain steps occur, push entries to a timeline.

Each timeline entry could show:
	•	A small icon indicating the type (SMS, Email, Rule, Schedule, Tagging, etc.).
	•	A label like:
	•	“Applied: New Lead tag”
	•	“Triggered: Service area check”
	•	“Scheduled: Appointment for Tue 2–4 PM”
	•	“Queued: 24-hour follow-up SMS”
	•	A timestamp (client-side time is fine).
	•	The mode/scenario it belongs to.

Example type:

type AutomationEventType =
  | "tag_applied"
  | "service_area_check"
  | "slot_proposed"
  | "booking_confirmed"
  | "followup_scheduled"
  | "review_request_queued"
  | "upsell_sequence_started";

interface AutomationEvent {
  id: string;
  type: AutomationEventType;
  label: string;
  description?: string;
  createdAt: number;
}

Display these in a vertical timeline:
	•	Animated entry (fade/slide in) whenever a new event is pushed.
	•	Color-coding by type (e.g., SMS-related, scheduling-related, follow-up-related).

Optional toggle:
	•	“Toggle: Show simple / Show advanced”
	•	Simple: just labels.
	•	Advanced: show an extra line of “pseudo-logic” for each event.

PRESET SCENARIOS (FLOW LOGIC)

For scenario modes (non “Free Play”), bootstrap the conversation with a scripted example that the user can join in.

MODE: New Lead → Booking
	•	Pre-seed with:
	•	Agent: “Hey! Thanks for reaching out to Clean Machine Auto Detail 👋 What are we working on today?”
	•	Expect user to say something like “My Honda Civic is really dirty, do you have time this week?”
	•	Agent behvior:
	•	Ask for name.
	•	Ask for address.
	•	Simulate service area check → timeline event “Service area check”.
	•	Propose 2–3 time windows.
	•	Confirm booking → automation events:
	•	“Booking confirmed”
	•	“Reminder SMS scheduled”
	•	“Customer tagged: New lead → Active”

MODE: Rain Reschedule
	•	Pre-seed conversation where:
	•	Agent sends a proactive message: “Weather looks rough for your detail tomorrow. We can keep it, move it indoors, or reschedule to a clear day. What works best for you?”
	•	If the user responds with “let’s reschedule”, agent:
	•	Proposes new times.
	•	Logs events:
	•	“Weather check: high chance of rain”
	•	“Reschedule suggestion sent”
	•	“Original job moved”
	•	“New appointment confirmed”

MODE: Follow-Up & Reviews
	•	Simulate:
	•	“Hope you’re loving your freshly detailed car! If you have 30 seconds, would you mind leaving a quick review? It really helps a small business like ours.”
	•	Timeline events:
	•	“Follow-up SMS sent”
	•	“Review request queued”
	•	“Customer added to maintenance reminder sequence”

MODE: Upsell & Packages
	•	Simulate:
	•	A post-job conversation where the agent suggests:
	•	Coating upgrades,
	•	Interior protectants,
	•	Membership / maintenance plan.
	•	Timeline events:
	•	“Upsell opportunity detected”
	•	“Offer: Ceramic coating package”
	•	“Follow-up upsell reminder scheduled”

MODE: Free Play
	•	No pre-seeded script beyond a greeting.
	•	Agent uses the rule engine to respond in a generic but on-brand way.
	•	Still logs events in the timeline where possible.

⸻

VISUAL + INTERACTION QUALITY

This sandbox should feel like a mini product inside the page:
	•	Use the same design system:
	•	Colors, typography, glass cards, shadows, etc.
	•	All interactions should have:
	•	Smooth transitions.
	•	Clear hover/focus states.
	•	Keyboard support for sending messages (Enter to send).
	•	On mobile:
	•	Chat should be full width with the timeline below.
	•	Tabs at the top scroll horizontally if needed.

COMPONENT STRUCTURE FOR SANDBOX

Create a separate component set, e.g.:

src/components/showcase/sandbox/
  SandboxSection.tsx
  SandboxModeTabs.tsx
  SandboxChat.tsx
  SandboxTimeline.tsx
  useSandboxState.ts
  sandboxConfig.ts

In CleanMachineShowcase.tsx, include this section in the layout:

import SandboxSection from "../components/showcase/sandbox/SandboxSection";

const CleanMachineShowcase: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-slate-950 text-slate-50">
      {/* sticky nav */}
      {/* other sections */}
      <SandboxSection id="sandbox" />
      {/* remaining sections */}
    </div>
  );
};

SandboxSection is responsible for:
	•	Handling the mode / scenario.
	•	Displaying the header + description.
	•	Rendering SandboxModeTabs, SandboxChat, and SandboxTimeline in a responsive layout.

useSandboxState hook:
	•	Manages:
	•	Current mode.
	•	Conversation state.
	•	Automation events.
	•	Exposes handlers:
	•	setMode(mode)
	•	sendCustomerMessage(text)

⸻

COPY & MESSAGING STYLE IN THE SANDBOX

All agent replies should:
	•	Sound like a real, friendly, competent service-business operator.
	•	Avoid sounding like a bot:
	•	Use natural phrasing, small variations, occasional emojis (sparingly).
	•	Emphasize:
	•	Clarity of next steps.
	•	Professionalism.
	•	Reassurance (“You’re all set”, “We’ve got you covered”, etc.).

No lorem ipsum in the sandbox either – everything should feel like a realistic customer conversation.

⸻

WHAT I WANT FROM YOU (REPLIT) FOR THIS ADD-ON
	1.	Implement the entire SandboxSection and supporting components as described.
	2.	Plug it into the Clean Machine showcase page with id="sandbox" and a nav link.
	3.	Make sure:
	•	The sandbox works without any backend.
	•	State updates feel instant and satisfying.
	•	The UI matches the quality level of the rest of the showcase.
	4.	Use clean, typed React + TypeScript, and keep logic readable so I can expand the scenarios later.

Now, extend the existing Clean Machine showcase implementation to include this interactive sandbox section and all its required components and logic.

You can just paste that whole block into Replit right after the original mega-prompt.  

Once Ghostwriter builds version 1 of the sandbox, send me the generated components (or screenshots) and I’ll help you tighten the logic, improve the fake “AI” behavior, and polish the UX even more.
