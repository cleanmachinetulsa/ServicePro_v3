Now focus ONLY on the Messages UI scroll bug.

Symptoms:
- On the /messages page, the center third "thread" panel does not scroll.
- I cannot scroll down to the bottom of the conversation.
- For some numbers, I cannot even reach the text input box to type a reply.
- This feels like the same scroll-container issue we previously had when using ScrollArea, but it has reappeared in ServicePro v3.

Goal:
Make the center thread panel fully scrollable again so:
- I can scroll up to see history.
- I can scroll down to the latest messages.
- I can always see and use the text input at the bottom.

Steps:
1. Open the main messages layout components, likely:
   - client/src/pages/MessagesPage.tsx (or similar)
   - client/src/components/messages/ThreadPane.tsx
   - client/src/components/messages/ThreadView.tsx
2. Inspect the layout:
   - The outer layout should be a flex container (3 columns).
   - The center column should have `flex: 1` and `min-height: 0`.
   - The inner scrollable area should be a `<div>` with `overflow-y: auto`, full height, and NOT wrapped in a Radix ScrollArea that resets scroll on re-render.

3. If you find a Radix `<ScrollArea>` around the thread content:
   - Replace it with a plain `<div>` scroll container.
   - Ensure we use a ref-based "scroll to bottom" pattern that does not fight browser scrolling.

4. Fix any CSS/Tailwind issues:
   - The column that holds the thread should have classes like:
     `flex flex-col min-h-0`
   - The messages list should have:
     `flex-1 overflow-y-auto`
   - The composer (text input) should sit in a non-scrolling footer with `shrink-0`.

5. Test behavior:
   - Long conversation: can scroll all the way up and down.
   - New message: view scrolls to bottom once (unless user has manually scrolled far up).
   - Input box is always visible at bottom.

6. Keep changes minimal:
   - Do not redesign the entire Messages page.
   - Just fix the scroll behavior and visibility of the input box.

At the end, summarize:
- Which files were changed.
- Before vs after behavior.
- Any gotchas (like needing `min-h-0` on a parent flex container).
