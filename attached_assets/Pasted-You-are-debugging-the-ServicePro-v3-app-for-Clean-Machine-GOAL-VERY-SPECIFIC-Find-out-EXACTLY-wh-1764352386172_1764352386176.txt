You are debugging the ServicePro v3 app for Clean Machine.

GOAL (VERY SPECIFIC)
Find out EXACTLY why the deployed app returns 500 JSON for:
/assets/index-oELbvrNQ.js
/assets/index-DB3t9imd.css

Do NOT refactor big pieces of code.
Just:
1) Log the static root path.
2) Log the real error for /assets/*.
3) List what files are actually in client/dist/assets.
Then summarize the findings for me.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT change tenantDb vs db usage anywhere.

--------------------------------
1) LOG STATIC ROOT PATH
--------------------------------
Open the main Express server entry file (likely server/index.ts).

Find where the frontend static path is defined, something like:

const clientDistPath = path.join(__dirname, "..", "client", "dist");

Right after that line, add:

console.log("[static] clientDistPath =", clientDistPath);

This is just for debugging; don’t change the path yet.

--------------------------------
2) LOG ERRORS FOR /assets/*
--------------------------------
Find the global error handler middleware, something like:

app.use((err, req, res, next) => { ... });

Inside it, BEFORE sending the response, add:

if (err && req.path && req.path.startsWith("/assets/")) {
  console.error("[asset-error]", {
    path: req.path,
    message: (err as any)?.message,
    stack: (err as any)?.stack,
  });
}

Do not change how the error response is sent, just log.

--------------------------------
3) LIST client/dist CONTENTS
--------------------------------
In the Replit shell, run:

ls -R client/dist 2>/dev/null | sed -e '1,200p'

Check whether you see:
- an assets/ folder under client/dist
- files named index-oELbvrNQ.js and index-DB3t9imd.css

If you can, paste the ls output into a comment at the top of server/index.ts like:

// DEBUG: client/dist contents:
// [paste first few lines here]

--------------------------------
4) HOW TO TEST
--------------------------------
1) Start the server / deploy as usual.
2) Hit this URL in the browser or with curl:
   https://servicepro-v-3-base-cleanmachinetul.replit.app/assets/index-oELbvrNQ.js
3) Check the server logs for:
   - [static] clientDistPath = ...
   - [asset-error] {...}

DO NOT "fix" anything else yet. Just gather:
- clientDistPath value
- Whether index-oELbvrNQ.js actually exists in client/dist/assets
- The exact error.message and stack for [asset-error]

Finally, summarize these findings in a short comment at the top of server/index.ts so I can see them next.
