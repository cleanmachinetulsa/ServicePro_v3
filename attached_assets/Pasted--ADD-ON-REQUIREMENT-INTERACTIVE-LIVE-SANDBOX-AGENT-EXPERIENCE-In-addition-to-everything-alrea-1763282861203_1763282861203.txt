### ADD-ON REQUIREMENT: INTERACTIVE "LIVE SANDBOX" AGENT EXPERIENCE

In addition to everything already specified for the Clean Machine showcase page, I want a **highly interactive sandbox section** where visitors can **try the agent**, see **simulated SMS-style conversations**, and watch **automations and alerts fire in real time**.

This is NOT connected to production infrastructure – it’s a **front-end simulation** that:
- Feels like a real conversation with the Clean Machine agent.
- Shows what happens "under the hood" as the agent triggers automations.
- Lets visitors run **preset scenarios** (like “New lead inquiry”, “Rain reschedule”, “Follow-up reminder”, etc).

---

## NEW SECTION: LIVE SANDBOX / TRY THE AGENT

Create a new section in the showcase page:

- ID: `#sandbox`
- Title: “Try the Clean Machine Agent”
- Add this section to the sticky nav so users can jump straight to it.

This section should have **three key parts**:

1. **Mode & Scenario Selector (top bar / left side)**
2. **Chat Simulator (primary focus)**
3. **Automation Timeline / Under-the-Hood View (right side or bottom)**

---

### 1. MODE & SCENARIO SELECTOR

At the top of the sandbox section, include:

- **Mode tabs** (pills):
  - “Free Play”
  - “New Lead → Booking”
  - “Rain Reschedule”
  - “Follow-Up & Reviews”
  - “Upsell & Packages”

When a user clicks a mode:

- It loads:
  - A **preset starting conversation** (if scenario-based).
  - A default “system state” for the automations.
- It also updates a short description of what they’re about to experience.

Visuals / UX:

- Use pill-style buttons with smooth animated underline/indicator.
- Show a 1–2 sentence description under the tabs:
  - Example: “New Lead → Booking: Experience how Clean Machine greets a new customer, checks their location, and locks in a time slot—all over SMS.”

---

### 2. CHAT SIMULATOR (CORE INTERACTIVE PIECE)

This is the main “wow” area.

Implement a **chat-style interface** that looks like a modern messaging app:

- Left/right bubbles for:
  - **Customer** messages (visitor input).
  - **Clean Machine Agent** replies (simulated).
- A chat input at the bottom:
  - Text field
  - “Send” button
  - (Optional) quick suggestion chips above the input for people who don’t know what to type.

Important:

- This sandbox does **NOT** need real AI. Instead:
  - Use front-end logic and a **small state machine** to produce **plausible, helpful replies**, based on:
    - Current mode (“New Lead”, “Rain”, etc.).
    - Keywords in the visitor’s message (e.g. “tomorrow”, “rain”, “outside area”).
    - A basic conversation state (e.g. “collecting address”, “offering times”, “confirming appointment”).

Implement a very simple rule engine for the sandbox:

- Example shape:

```ts
type SandboxMode =
  | "free-play"
  | "new-lead"
  | "rain"
  | "follow-up"
  | "upsell";

type ConversationStep =
  | "greeting"
  | "collecting_name"
  | "collecting_address"
  | "checking_service_area"
  | "offering_slots"
  | "confirming_booking"
  | "post_job_followup"
  | "review_request"
  | "upsell_offer"
  | "complete";

interface SandboxState {
  mode: SandboxMode;
  step: ConversationStep;
  messages: Array<{
    id: string;
    from: "customer" | "agent";
    text: string;
    timestamp: number;
  }>;
}
