You are working in the ServicePro_v3 project.

Goal: 
My Clean Machine domain (cleanmachinetulsa.com) is currently showing a new auto-generated landing page instead of my original hand-built homepage. 

I want you to:
1) Precisely map HOW the current homepage is chosen for cleanmachinetulsa.com.
2) Find my older/custom homepage component(s).
3) Propose the *minimal* routing change needed to point the domain back to my original homepage.
4) DO NOT APPLY ANY CHANGES YET. Just report.

---

STEP 1 – Map current routing for Clean Machine domain

1. Open these files (or their closest equivalents if names differ):
   - shared/domainConfig.ts
   - client/src/components/RootDomainHandler.tsx
   - client/src/App.tsx
   - any file that defines the main <Routes> or router.

2. Determine, **for host = cleanmachinetulsa.com or www.cleanmachinetulsa.com**:
   - Which React component ends up rendering when I hit "/" in the browser.
   - Whether it redirects to something like "/site/cleanmachine" or another path.
   - The full chain, e.g.:

     host → RootDomainHandler → path "/site/cleanmachine" → Component XYZ

3. In your final report, clearly list:
   - The exact component name and file that currently powers the homepage for Clean Machine.
   - The path it is mounted on ("/", "/site/cleanmachine", etc.).

DO NOT modify any files in this step.

STEP 2 – Find my original custom homepage component(s)

1. Search the codebase for likely marketing/homepage components, including:
   - Files in client/src/pages/*
   - Files in client/src/components/public/*
   - Any component containing text like:
     - "Clean Machine Auto Detail"
     - "Clean Machine"
     - "Mobile Auto Detailing"
     - or other obvious homepage copy if present.

2. Also check git history for earlier versions (before the “Public Site v2 / CM-4” work) of:
   - client/src/App.tsx
   - any previous “Home”, “Landing”, or “PublicSite” page.

3. Identify 1–3 best candidates for my **original hand-built homepage**, and for each candidate include in the report:
   - File path
   - Component name
   - First <h1> or main hero text
   - A one-line description of the layout (e.g. “dark gradient, two buttons, hero image on the right”).

Again: DO NOT change any code yet.

---

STEP 3 – Propose minimal routing fix (but DO NOT apply)

Based on Steps 1 and 2, propose the **simplest possible fix** that:

- Keeps all existing DNS + SSL + multi-tenant logic.
- Keeps the Clean Machine tenant mapping intact.
- Changes ONLY which component is rendered as the homepage for:
  - cleanmachinetulsa.com
  - www.cleanmachinetulsa.com

Most likely options (choose the best one in your proposal):

A) In RootDomainHandler.tsx:
   - When host matches Clean Machine, navigate to a different route 
     (e.g. "/cm-home") that renders my original homepage component.

B) Adjust the mapping in domainConfig.ts (or similar config) to point the Clean Machine domain to the original homepage route instead of "/site/cleanmachine".

In your final report, you MUST:

- Show the CURRENT logic (before change) as code snippets.
- Show the PROPOSED new logic as code snippets (but do NOT edit files yet).
- Explicitly tell me: 
  - “If you approve, I will rewire the Clean Machine domain to use: [component name] in [file path] mounted at [route path].”

Do not perform any edits. Stop after generating the report and wait for my confirmation.
