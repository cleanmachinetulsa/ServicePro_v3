Thank you for pasting the Replit reply — that’s exactly what we needed.

We’re all on the same page now:

✅ Canonical, correct, future-proof SIP domain:
cleanmachinetulsa.sip.twilio.com
❌ Do NOT use: cleanmachinetulsa.sip.us1.twilio.com

Replit literally said:

“GPT is correct… I was wrong… canonical configuration is cleanmachinetulsa.sip.twilio.com.”

So there’s no more “AI vs AI” conflict — both sides are aligned now.

1. What you should do RIGHT NOW
A. Fix Groundwire (if you changed it)

On your Android phone, in Groundwire, for your Clean Machine account:

SIP Server / Domain:
cleanmachinetulsa.sip.twilio.com

Username: jody

Password: your Twilio SIP credential

Transport: UDP (totally fine for now)

➡️ After saving, the account should show Registered / green.
If it’s already green with exactly that domain, don’t touch it.

B. Twilio phone number webhooks (just confirm)

For +1 918 856 5304 in the Twilio console:

Voice & Fax

A call comes in:
Webhook →

https://servicepro-v-3-base-cleanmachinetul.replit.app/twilio/voice/incoming


Method: HTTP POST

Call status callback URL:

https://servicepro-v-3-base-cleanmachinetul.replit.app/twilio/voice/call-status


Method: HTTP POST

Messaging

A message comes in:

https://servicepro-v-3-base-cleanmachinetul.replit.app/api/twilio/sms/inbound


Method: HTTP POST

Once those are set, all the plumbing from Twilio → ServicePro v3 is pointed correctly.

2. Test plan (voice + voicemail + push + SMS)

Here’s your clean checklist. You can literally walk down this list and tick things off.

✅ Test 1 – Groundwire registration

What you do:

Open Groundwire → Account list → tap the Clean Machine account.

Expected:

Status shows Registered / green.

If it’s not registered:

Double-check:

Domain exactly: cleanmachinetulsa.sip.twilio.com

Username: jody

Password: matches Twilio credentials

✅ Test 2 – Incoming call → live ring

What you do:

From a different phone, call +1 918 856 5304.

Just listen and watch Groundwire.

Expected behavior:

You hear your greeting / IVR (depending on business-hours/ivr_mode).

Your Groundwire app rings.

If you answer on Groundwire:

You can talk both ways.

In ServicePro v3, the call should show up in recent calls / logs.

If the call never rings Groundwire but you hear IVR, tell me:
“IVR plays, but 2 doesn’t ring Groundwire” vs “Straight to voicemail” etc. That distinction matters.

✅ Test 3 – Missed call → voicemail → push notification

What you do:

Call +1 918 856 5304 again.

Let it ring on Groundwire, do not answer.

When IVR plays, choose the voicemail path (whatever key the menu says, typically 3).

Leave a clear 10–15s voicemail, then hang up.

Expected:

Within a few seconds, on your ServicePro PWA:

You see a push notification like “New voicemail from +1…”.

In the app:

On the Messages / Phone view, a voicemail entry appears with:

Audio player (play/pause)

Metadata/type voicemail

After ~30–60 seconds:

Transcription text appears on that voicemail message.

✅ Test 4 – IVR options (including “press 2 to talk to someone”)

What you do:

Call +1 918 856 5304.

When IVR menu plays, press:

1 → pricing SMS

2 → talk to someone (SIP dial)

3 → voicemail

Expected:

Press 1 → you get an SMS with pricing info.

Press 2 → Groundwire rings (dials sip:jody@cleanmachinetulsa.sip.twilio.com).

Press 3 → voicemail flow from Test 3.

If 2 doesn’t ring Groundwire but everything else works, we know the problem is specifically in the SIP dial leg, not webhooks in general.

✅ Test 5 – SMS integration

What you do:

From another phone, send an SMS to +1 918 856 5304.

Watch the ServicePro app.

Expected:

A conversation appears on the Messages/Night Ops view.

AI responds (per your Clean Machine behavior rules).

If the AI marks it as needing attention, you should get a push notification in the PWA.

3. Extra little thing you asked about: “Caller Name Lookup”

That Caller Name Lookup $0.01 thing in Twilio:

It is not the same as Caller ID passthrough.

Caller ID passthrough = you see the caller’s number.

Caller Name Lookup (CNAM) = Twilio goes out and looks up the name associated with the number (like “JOHN SMITH” or the business name) and charges per lookup.

You do not need Caller Name Lookup for SIP / Groundwire / IVR to work. It’s just an optional lookup for extra info.

4. Where we stand now

✅ You + Replit + me are finally aligned:
cleanmachinetulsa.sip.twilio.com is the only domain we should use.

✅ Your code and DB already use that form everywhere.

✅ Replit explicitly admitted the .us1 thing was their mistake.

So now it’s not “who do I trust?” — it’s:

We have one canonical config, and now we just need to test the actual behavior.

Once you’ve:

Confirmed Groundwire is Registered with cleanmachinetulsa.sip.twilio.com, and

Updated the Twilio number to the ServicePro v3 URLs,

you can walk through those tests and then tell me:

Which steps passed,

Which one (if any) broke, and

What you saw/heard (e.g., “IVR played but 2 = silence,” “no voicemail push,” etc.).

From there we’ll surgically fix only the failing piece instead of you being stuck in three-way AI telephone.
