You are the AI developer for the ServicePro v3 multi-tenant SaaS app.

We just finished major IVR + phone work and a Messages performance pass.  
Now we want to ship a **coherent, self-service onboarding flow** for new tenants.

Your job in this block is to implement a **complete, high-quality funnel**:

- Public Landing → Industry Onboarding → Setup Wizard → Dashboard

…while reusing the existing building blocks you already found:

- /onboarding/industry
- /setup-copilot
- /dashboard
- /site/:subdomain
- existing industry packs and tenant bootstrap logic

Do NOT break existing tenants or the root “Clean Machine” business.

------------------------------------------------------------
HIGH-LEVEL PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------

### 1) Public Landing Page at “/”

Create a proper marketing landing page and route it as the default root:

- URL: `/`
- Component: `client/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` (you’ve started this; now finish it properly)
- Router: ensure `App.tsx` (or equivalent router file) routes `/` → `LandingPage` and that `/onboarding/industry` remains the CTA.

Landing page content:

- Hero section:
  - Big headline: “ServicePro – AI-powered automation for service businesses”
  - Subheading: “Bookings, messages, and follow-ups handled for you – so you can focus on the work.”
  - Primary CTA button: “Get Started” → navigates to `/onboarding/industry`
  - Secondary CTA: “View demo site” → links to a safe sample like `/site/demo-detailing` if available, or disabled/placeholder.

- “How it works” section:
  - 3–4 steps, visually:
    1. “Pick your industry”
    2. “Answer a few questions”
    3. “Connect your phone & SMS”
    4. “Launch your AI-powered booking site”

- “Supported industries” section:
  - Show cards for some industries (auto detailing, lawn care, house cleaning, photography, HVAC, etc.) using the same labels used in `/onboarding/industry`.

- Simple footer:
  - Links: “Login”, “Privacy”, “Terms”
  - “Powered by ServicePro”

Use the same design language as the existing app (Tailwind, gradients, glass cards, etc.). This page should feel premium, not thrown together.

### 2) Refine /onboarding/industry -> redirect into Setup Wizard

You already know:

- File: `client/src/pages/OnboardingIndustry.tsx`
- Flow: select industry → (optional photography specializations) → username/email/password → POST `/api/onboarding/complete` → currently redirect to `/dashboard` (or similar).

Change this so that AFTER a successful onboarding:

- The user is auto-logged in (keep existing behavior).
- Instead of going straight to `/dashboard`, redirect them to:

  - `/setup-copilot` (Setup Wizard page)

You mentioned this route already exists – we’ll enhance it in the next step.

Also:

- Improve copy on the success path to make it clear:
  - “Account created! Next we’ll walk you through a 3-step setup to get your phone, website, and AI assistant ready.”

Do NOT change the backend behavior of `/api/onboarding/complete` (tenant creation + industry pack seeding) other than minimal tweaks if strictly necessary.

### 3) Setup Wizard (“Setup Copilot”) at /setup-copilot

We want `/setup-copilot` to become the **central post-signup funnel**.

- File (or create if not present): `client/src/pages/SetupCopilot.tsx`
- Route: `/setup-copilot` (must be auth-protected, owner role only).

This page should show a **3-step checklist** with progress:

1. **Step 1: Business Basics & Services**
   - Status: “Done” if the tenant’s industry pack + services are already seeded (likely always true), but let them:
     - See their business name and primary industry.
     - Edit displayed business name (e.g. “Clean Machine Auto Detail”).
     - Confirm services/pricing imported from the industry pack (link to the existing Services/Settings page in a button: “Review services & pricing”).
   - Action button: “Mark as Complete” if they’ve visited/reviewed (or auto-mark as complete if data present).

2. **Step 2: Phone & SMS Setup**
   - Status should reflect backend data:
     - “Not Configured” if there is no main phone / messaging config for this tenant.
     - “Partially Configured” if Twilio SID/messaging service exists but tests fail.
     - “Ready” if your existing phone config for tenant passes a simple health check.
   - UI:
     - Show a short explanation: “ServicePro uses your Twilio config to send/receive calls and SMS via the AI agent.”
     - Show key fields pulled from backend (masked where needed): phone number, SIP domain, messaging service SID, etc.
     - Buttons:
       - “Open Phone Settings” → link to the existing admin phone config page (whatever route you already use to configure phone for the root tenant).
       - “Send Test SMS” – optional; if trivial, wire a small test endpoint that sends a “Test message from ServicePro” SMS to the owner phone (root tenant only for now).
   - For non-root tenants in this v1:
     - You can show guidance text + a button that says “Contact Support to Connect Phone” or similar, if full multi-tenant Twilio is not ready yet.
   - Keep this step read-only for now except for simple actions; the goal is primarily feedback and linking to the proper settings screen.

3. **Step 3: Public Website & Booking Link**
   - Leverage your existing website generator for `/site/:subdomain`.
   - From Setup Wizard:
     - Show:
       - Current business name
       - Current tagline
       - Current primary CTA text (e.g. “Book Now”)
       - The generated public URL (e.g. `https://servicepro-v-3-base-cleanmachinetul.replit.app/site/{subdomain}`).
     - Provide a “Preview Site” button that opens `/site/:subdomain` in a new tab.
     - Provide a button “Edit Website Copy” → link into your existing website config/editor page (if already created), or show inline fields for:
       - hero title
       - hero subtitle
       - primary CTA button text.
   - Include a “Mark as Published” toggle/checkbox so the tenant can indicate “Yes, I’m ready for customers to see this.”

#### Backend tracking: setup progress

Add a small, non-invasive tracking mechanism for these 3 steps.

- In `tenant_config` (or equivalent tenant settings table), add:

  - `onboarding_business_setup_done` (boolean, default false)
  - `onboarding_phone_setup_done` (boolean, default false)
  - `onboarding_site_published` (boolean, default false)

- Create lightweight endpoints:

  - `GET /api/onboarding/progress`
    - Returns the current tenant’s flags and any derived status (e.g., infer phone_ready from phone config if you can).
  
  - `POST /api/onboarding/progress`
    - Accepts optional booleans to update:
      - `{ businessSetupDone?: boolean; phoneSetupDone?: boolean; sitePublished?: boolean }`
    - Auth: owner-only, tenant-scoped.

`SetupCopilot.tsx` should:

- Use `GET /api/onboarding/progress` to drive the UI.
- Use `POST /api/onboarding/progress` when the user clicks “Mark as complete” / “Mark as published”.

Keep logic simple and robust. If you can infer a “Done” status from actual config (e.g. phone is already working), that’s great, but never crash if the inference fails – default to “Not configured” and show guidance.

### 4) Dashboard “Finish Setup” Banner

On the main owner/tenant dashboard (`/dashboard`):

- Add a small, unobtrusive **banner card** at the top that appears only when **any of the three onboarding flags are not done**.

Banner behavior:

- If all flags true → banner hidden.
- If not, show:
  - Title: “Finish setting up your ServicePro workspace”
  - Text: e.g. “You’re almost there! Complete 3 quick steps to start taking bookings with AI.”
  - Progress indicator:
    - Show 0/3, 1/3, 2/3, 3/3 completed.
  - Button: “Open Setup Copilot” → navigate to `/setup-copilot`.

Implementation details:

- Reuse the `GET /api/onboarding/progress` endpoint.
- Prefer TanStack Query or whatever caching system you already use for user/tenant data.
- Make sure this is tenant-scoped and not leaking root tenant data.

------------------------------------------------------------
TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS & SAFETY
------------------------------------------------------------

- Do NOT break existing tenant creation logic in `/api/onboarding/complete`.
- Do NOT change existing Twilio / phone behavior, only surface its status.
- Multi-tenant safety:
  - All onboarding/progress endpoints MUST be tenant-scoped, using the same auth and `wrapTenantDb` patterns used elsewhere.
- Treat non-root tenants gracefully:
  - If full phone integration isn’t ready per-tenant, show guidance text/instructional UI instead of advanced actions.
- No removal of existing routes like `/admin/concierge-setup` – those remain as internal tools.

------------------------------------------------------------
DELIVERABLE SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------

When you’re done, summarize:

1. Files created/modified (paths + a short line per file).
2. Schema changes:
   - New flags in tenant_config (or equivalent) and any new API routes.
3. How the tenant onboarding funnel works now, end-to-end:
   - From `/` to `/onboarding/industry` to `/setup-copilot` to `/dashboard` and `/site/:subdomain`.
4. Any caveats / TODOs (e.g. future Stripe/billing, fully automated phone provisioning, etc.).

Ensure everything builds and the app boots cleanly before finishing.
