Task: Add high-quality hero images to each industry in the onboarding selector grid.

Project: Servicepro app (Servicepro-v3-base)

Working style:
- I (the user) will NOT edit any files manually.
- You must:
  - Find the correct files
  - Add fields to the config
  - Update the UI to render images
- I only paste this prompt and run it. At the end, show me a clear summary of what changed.

Goal:
The industry selector at /admin/onboarding-industry should show a high-quality, relevant image on each industry card (auto detailing, house cleaning, hair stylist / barber, photography, etc.). Images should:

- Visually match the industry (no random placeholders)
- Be landscape hero-style images (banner-like, wide not tall)
- Load via HTTPS from a stable image CDN (e.g., Unsplash, Pexels, etc.)
- Look good with Tailwind styling (rounded corners, object-cover, etc.)

The underlying behavior (selection, feature flags, save & continue) must remain unchanged.

Step 1 – Use src/config/industryPacks.ts as the source of truth
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Open: src/config/industryPacks.ts
2. Confirm this file contains the full list of industries (around 20), including:
   - auto detailing
   - house cleaning
   - lawn care
   - pool service
   - pressure washing
   - pest control
   - pet grooming
   - window cleaning
   - handyman services
   - photography & media
   - hair stylist / barber
   - etc.

This file is the single source of truth for available industries. DO NOT reduce or trim this list.

Step 2 – Extend the industry pack type with image fields
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Find the type/interface used for each industry pack in src/config/industryPacks.ts. It might be something like:

   interface IndustryPack {
     id: string;
     name: string;
     // ...
   }

2. Extend that type to include:

   - imageUrl: string;
   - imageAlt?: string; // optional alt text for accessibility

3. For EVERY industry in the export (all ~20), set:

   - imageUrl to a HIGH-QUALITY, RELEVANT image URL hosted on a stable image CDN (Unsplash, Pexels, etc.). Use HTTPS links.
     Examples of types of images to choose (exact URLs are up to you):
     - Auto Detailing: close-up of a car being detailed / polished
     - House Cleaning: clean modern living room or person cleaning
     - Lawn Care: green lawn with someone mowing or trimming
     - Pressure Washing: driveway or siding being pressure washed
     - Pool Service: clean swimming pool / service tech at pool
     - Pest Control: technician in protective gear at home exterior
     - Pet Grooming: dog being groomed at grooming station
     - Window Cleaning: person cleaning large windows/glass
     - Handyman: tools or handyman working
     - Hair Stylist / Barber: barbershop chair / stylist cutting hair
     - Photography & Media: photographer with camera in action
     - HVAC: tech working on AC unit
     - Junk Removal: truck with junk being loaded
     - Moving Services: movers carrying boxes
     - Fence & Deck: fresh wooden deck / fence
     - Real Estate / Property Services: nice home exterior
     - Carpet Cleaning: professional carpet cleaning in progress
     etc.

   - imageAlt to a short description like:
     - "Car being detailed"
     - "Cleaner in modern living room"
     - "Barber cutting hair in barbershop"
     - "Photographer shooting a wedding"
     etc.

IMPORTANT:
- Use DIRECT image URLs that resolve to image content, not to HTML pages.
- All URLs must be HTTPS.
- Prefer images that are reasonably wide (16:9 or similar) so they crop nicely in a card.

Step 3 – Update the industry onboarding page to render images
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Find the onboarding page that renders the industry grid. Likely:

   - src/pages/OnboardingIndustry.tsx
   OR
   - client/src/pages/OnboardingIndustry.tsx

This is the same file you wired up in Phases 8A–8C.

2. Confirm this page now imports the industry list from src/config/industryPacks.ts (you previously updated it in the last step we ran).

3. In the card rendering, update each industry card to show the image at the top. For example, if you currently have something like:

   <Card ...>
     <CardHeader>
       <CardTitle>{ind.name}</CardTitle>
     </CardHeader>
     ...
   </Card>

Change it to something like (adjusting to the actual component structure):

   <Card ...>
     {ind.imageUrl && (
       <div className="w-full h-32 overflow-hidden rounded-t-md">
         <img
           src={ind.imageUrl}
           alt={ind.imageAlt || ind.name}
           className="w-full h-full object-cover"
           loading="lazy"
         />
       </div>
     )}
     <CardHeader>
       <CardTitle>{ind.name}</CardTitle>
     </CardHeader>
     ...
   </Card>

Key requirements:
- Use Tailwind (or existing className approach) to make the image:
  - full width of card
  - fixed height (e.g. h-32 or h-40)
  - object-cover to avoid distortion
  - rounded top corners to match card (rounded-t-md or similar)
- Add loading="lazy" on the <img> for performance.
- If an industry somehow has no imageUrl, just render the card without the image (no crash).

4. Do NOT change the selection logic:
   - Clicking a card should still set selectedIndustry exactly as before.
   - Styling for selected vs non-selected cards should remain the same (just with image above).

5. Do NOT change the POST payload to /api/onboarding/industry. No new fields are needed in the payload. Images are purely visual.

Step 4 – Basic validation
-------------------------
1. Restart the dev server.
2. Open /admin/onboarding-industry in the dev browser.
3. Confirm:
   - Every industry card now shows a high-quality, relevant image.
   - The grid still looks clean and responsive.
   - Hover/selected styling still works.
   - Clicking “Save & Continue” still works exactly as before (status toast + API call).

Step 5 – Report back
--------------------
When you are done, please provide:

1. A list of files you changed:
   - e.g., src/config/industryPacks.ts
   - e.g., src/pages/OnboardingIndustry.tsx (or whatever file you updated for the UI)
2. A short explanation of:
   - How the imageUrl/imageAlt fields are structured in the config.
   - How the image is rendered in the card (what classes / layout).
3. Confirmation that:
   - All industries now display appropriate images.
   - The behavior of selecting an industry and saving the onboarding form is unchanged.

Please apply all edits automatically and show me the summary when you’re done.
