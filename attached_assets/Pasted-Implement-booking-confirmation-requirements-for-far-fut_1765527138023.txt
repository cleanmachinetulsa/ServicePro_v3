Implement booking confirmation requirements for far-future bookings (up to 90 days) with reminder-confirm workflow.

GOALS:
- Allow booking creation up to 90 days out (already implied by availability horizon).
- For bookings scheduled >= 14 days away: mark as "needs_confirmation".
- Send reminders:
  - 7 days before: “Reply CONFIRM to keep your appointment”
  - 48 hours before: “Reply CONFIRM or RESCHEDULE”
- If customer replies CONFIRM: mark confirmed and stop confirmation reminders.
- Auto-cancel is OPTIONAL and OFF by default. If enabled via env AUTO_CANCEL_UNCONFIRMED=1:
  - If not confirmed by 24 hours before, cancel the calendar event and notify owner + customer.
- Always notify owner when booking is created AND when booking is auto-canceled (if enabled).

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
1) Update your booking persistence model:
   - Locate the table/model you use for bookings (or appointments).
   - Add columns/fields:
     - needsConfirmation boolean default false
     - confirmedAt timestamp nullable
     - confirmationToken optional (can be blank; not required)
     - lastConfirmationReminderAt timestamp nullable
     - autoCanceledAt timestamp nullable
   If you don’t have a bookings table and you only rely on Google Calendar events:
   - Create a lightweight table “sms_booking_records” keyed by tenant_id + phone + event_id with the fields above plus start_time, service, address.
   - Use Drizzle schema in shared/schema.ts.

2) Update booking creation path:
   - In server/routes/twilioTestSms.ts wherever you call handleBook()/create calendar event:
     - After success (eventId exists), compute daysUntil = (startTime - now)/days
     - If daysUntil >= 14:
       - set needsConfirmation=true on the booking record
       - Include in confirmation SMS:
         “You’re all set for {Day} {Time}. I’ll text you closer to confirm.”
     - If daysUntil < 14:
       - normal confirmation SMS.

3) Add SMS command handling for CONFIRM / RESCHEDULE:
   - In inbound SMS handler, BEFORE LLM:
     - If Body matches /^confirm\b/i:
       - Find the most recent upcoming booking record for that phone+tenant within next 90 days that needsConfirmation=true and confirmedAt is null
       - Set confirmedAt=now, needsConfirmation=false
       - Reply deterministically: “Confirmed ✅ See you {Day} at {Time}. Reply CHANGE if you need to reschedule.”
     - If Body matches /^reschedule\b|^change\b/i:
       - Mark booking as “reschedule_requested” (add field) and route to availability offering flow for that service.

4) Add a small cron job/service:
   - Create server/services/bookingConfirmationMonitor.ts
     - Runs every hour
     - Finds upcoming bookings with needsConfirmation=true and confirmedAt null
     - If now is ~7 days before and lastConfirmationReminderAt is null or older than 6 days -> send reminder SMS
     - If now is ~48 hours before and lastConfirmationReminderAt older than 36h -> send reminder SMS
     - If AUTO_CANCEL_UNCONFIRMED=1 and now is within 24 hours and still unconfirmed -> cancel event + mark autoCanceledAt + notify owner + customer
   - Plug into your existing cron bootstrap file (where unanswered monitor / campaign jobs run).
   - Make sure it is tenant-scoped and safe.

5) Logging (must-have):
   - [CONFIRM MONITOR] tenant=<id> due7d=3 due48h=2 autocancel=0
   - [CONFIRM] phone=... eventId=... confirmedAt=...
   - [AUTO CANCEL] phone=... eventId=... reason=unconfirmed_24h

6) SMS length:
   - Apply truncateSmsResponse() to these deterministic reminder/confirm replies too.

Return a summary + exact tests:
- Create a booking 20+ days out -> verify needsConfirmation set and reminder text style
- Send “CONFIRM” -> verify it marks confirmed and monitor stops reminding.
