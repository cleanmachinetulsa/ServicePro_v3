Hi Jody Beeson,

Thanks for submitting a porting request to Twilio.

**Please double check the numbers listed at the bottom of this email to ensure the accuracy and completeness of your port request and that all numbers were submitted successfully.**

The status of each outstanding port request is displayed in the numbers tab of your Twilio [Dashboard](http://twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/porting-requests), you can access it by clicking [here](https://twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/porting-requests).

**Porting Timelines for voice and sms porting:**
Please note that we may need to reach out to you during the process for more information, and we will use this email thread to provide you with updates.

1. For requests of **less than 50** numbers it can typically take **5-11 days**.
3. For requests of **50 or more** numbers the process might take **1-6 weeks**.
3. **SMS can take up to 3 business days** after the porting date to be activated within the Twilio network as all carriers must update their routing records.
4. Consider that timelines might be extended if the port is temporarily rejected by any telecom carriers/underlying carriers involved.

**Number configuration:**
Each number must be configured prior to the porting process to avoid downtime. To ensure continuity of service, you should visit the status page on your Twilio [Dashboard](http://twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/porting-requests) as soon as you submit the port request and configure a voice URL, messaging URL, and/or SIP trunk for each number.

The steps of the porting process are as follows:

Step 1 - Submit documentation to Twilio - **Successfully completed.**
Step 2 - Twilio will submit the port request to the carriers based on the data and information you’ve provided.
Step 3 - Twilio will follow up with the carriers and/or you if more information is required.
Step 4 - Twilio will receive the date on which your number(s) will port and notify you via email.
Step 5 - Your phone number(s) will port and Twilio will test to ensure voice is working.

If you have questions about this at any point, please do not hesitate to reply to this email.

The Port Request SID shown below is the unique identifier for this port request; please include it in your future inquiries.
