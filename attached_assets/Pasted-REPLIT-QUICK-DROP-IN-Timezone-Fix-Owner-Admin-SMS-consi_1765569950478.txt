REPLIT QUICK DROP-IN (Timezone Fix + Owner/Admin SMS consistency)

Goal:
Fix the timezone / time display mismatch in owner/admin SMS notifications and any human-facing time strings related to bookings.
The system currently logs/uses UTC (e.g. 2025-12-12T18:46:51.763Z) but owner SMS sometimes displays the wrong local time or wrong day.
We want:
- Keep storage/logic in UTC
- Format ALL human-facing times (owner SMS + customer SMS confirmations + emails where applicable) using tenant timezone, default "America/Chicago"
- Do NOT break existing booking creation or calendar integration
- Add minimal, high-signal logs to verify formatting

Instructions:
1) Search the codebase for where the owner/admin SMS is constructed/sent. Likely keywords:
   - "BUSINESS_OWNER_PERSONAL_PHONE"
   - "OWNER NOTIFY"
   - "admin"
   - "notify"
   - "Booked via SMS"
   - "Appointment scheduled"
   - "New booking"
   - "CHANGE to reschedule"
   - "sendSms(" or "twilio.messages.create"
   Identify the exact file(s) and function(s) that build the message body.

2) Implement a single shared helper utility used everywhere for formatting:
   Create: server/utils/timeFormat.ts
   Export:
     - getTenantTimeZone(tenant?: any): string  // returns tenant.timezone or process.env.DEFAULT_TIMEZONE or "America/Chicago"
     - formatLocalDateTime(date: Date | string, tz: string, style?: "short" | "long"): string
       Use date-fns-tz if already installed; if not installed, add a minimal dependency OR use Intl.DateTimeFormat with timeZone.
       Desired output examples:
         "Sat Dec 13 at 9:00 AM"
         "Fri Dec 12 at 12:46 PM"
       Always include day + time for bookings.

3) Apply the helper to owner/admin SMS:
   - Wherever the admin SMS currently uses:
       new Date(), toLocaleString(), Date.toString(), or raw ISO timestamps
     replace with:
       formatLocalDateTime(eventStart, tz, "long")
   - Ensure the message uses the BOOKED SLOT time, not "now".
   - If the booking payload has a "slot" string and also a Date/ISO, prefer the real Date/ISO for correctness.

4) Apply the helper to customer-facing confirmation SMS/email too (only where time is shown):
   - If you find customer confirmation uses a local slot string already, leave it.
   - If it formats Date objects, enforce tenant timezone.

5) Add verification logs (do not log secrets):
   In the booking success path (where eventId exists), add ONE log line:
     [TIMEZONE FIX] tenant=<id or slug> tz=<tz> eventStartUtc=<iso> local=<formatted>
   And for owner notify:
     [OWNER NOTIFY] tz=<tz> localTime=<formatted> phone=<masked last4>

6) Safety:
   - Fail-open: If formatting fails, fall back to existing slot string.
   - Do not change booking logic, only formatting.

7) After changes:
   - Ensure TypeScript compiles
   - Run: npm run check
   - Run: npm run smoke:sms
   - Provide me a short summary: which files changed, where the owner SMS lives, and 1 example log line showing UTC vs local formatting.

Deliverables:
- server/utils/timeFormat.ts (new)
- Modified owner/admin SMS send location(s)
- Any modified customer confirmation formatting location(s)
- Added [TIMEZONE FIX] logs

Make the changes now.
