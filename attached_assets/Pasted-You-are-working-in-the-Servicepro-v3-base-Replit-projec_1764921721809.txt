You are working in the Servicepro-v3-base Replit project.

GOAL
Fix the current "Internal Server Error" and finalize routing for the three public entry points:

- "/"          → Clean Machine public booking homepage
- "/home"      → same Clean Machine homepage (alias)
- "/servicepro"→ ServicePro marketing landing page

We previously tried to rewire "/" and broke something. Repair this cleanly.

STEP 1 – Find the routing definition
1. Locate the main React router configuration (likely in client/src/App.tsx, client/src/router.tsx, or similar).
2. Identify:
   - The component that currently renders the Clean Machine public homepage (the one used for "/home").
   - The ServicePro marketing landing page component (the one we recently added and wired to "/").

Name them clearly in comments so it's obvious which is which.

STEP 2 – Fix imports and components
1. Ensure BOTH components are imported correctly at the top of the router file:
   - CleanMachineHomePage (or whatever it's actually named)
   - ServiceProLandingPage (or similar)
2. Remove any unused/duplicate imports for older landing/home components that are no longer used.

If the Clean Machine homepage is only defined inline for "/home" and not as a standalone component, refactor it into a named component so both "/" and "/home" can reuse it.

STEP 3 – Define the routes EXACTLY like this (adjusting names to real component names)

In the router JSX:

- A redirect at root:

   <Route
     path="/"
     element={<Navigate replace to="/home" />}
   />

- The Clean Machine homepage (existing behavior):

   <Route
     path="/home"
     element={<CleanMachineHomePage />}
   />

- The ServicePro marketing page:

   <Route
     path="/servicepro"
     element={<ServiceProLandingPage />}
   />

NOTES:
- There must be **only one** Route for path="/" (the redirect).
- Do NOT remove any auth-protected routes, dashboard routes, or tenant routes.
- Keep any existing 404 / catch-all route in place.

STEP 4 – Update “View Demo Site” on the marketing page
1. Open the ServicePro marketing landing page component (the one with the big hero saying “ServicePro – AI-powered automation for service businesses”).
2. Update the “View Demo Site” button so it links to "/home" (the Clean Machine site) in a new tab or current tab. For example:

   - If using a <Link>:
       <Link to="/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">View Demo Site</Link>

   - Or if using onClick with navigate, then navigate("/home").

3. Make sure the “Get Started Free” button still points to the onboarding route (e.g. "/onboarding/industry") and still works.

STEP 5 – Build & sanity checks
1. Run the dev server / tests that Replit normally runs and ensure there are **no TypeScript or runtime errors**.
2. Manually verify, in the running app:

   - Going to "/" loads the Clean Machine homepage (or immediately redirects to "/home" which shows that page).
   - Going to "/home" shows the same Clean Machine homepage.
   - Going to "/servicepro" shows the ServicePro marketing landing page.
   - On "/servicepro":
       - "Get Started Free" opens the onboarding/signup flow.
       - "View Demo Site" opens "/home".

3. Confirm the "Internal Server Error" is resolved and pages render instead of a 500 screen.

STEP 6 – Report back
In a final comment at the bottom of the main router file, briefly note what changed, e.g.:

// Routing NOTE (Dec 5):
// "/" → redirects to "/home" (Clean Machine public site)
// "/home" → CleanMachineHomePage
// "/servicepro" → ServiceProLandingPage

Do NOT change any phone, IVR, A2P, or backend API logic in this block unless absolutely required to fix the error.
