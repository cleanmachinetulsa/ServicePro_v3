You are working on the ServicePro_v3 repo.

TASK: Add a guided “Phone History Migration” wizard UI on top of the existing import engine from INT-3, so non-technical users can easily migrate their old phone data.

Requirements:

1. New Admin Page: `/admin/migration-wizard`
   - 3–4 step wizard:
     Step 1 – “Prepare your export”
       - Explains, in plain language, what the parser tool is and why it matters:
         - “Download your phone/Google Voice data”
         - “Upload it into the Parser Tool”
         - “Download the ‘ServicePro Bundle’ ZIP”
       - Include a button link to the external Parser Tool URL (string constant for now).
     Step 2 – “Upload your bundle”
       - File upload for the ZIP.
       - Shows a short checklist:
         - [ ] Customers detected
         - [ ] Conversations detected
         - [ ] Messages detected
       - Under the hood, this simply calls the same POST `/api/admin/import-history/upload` endpoint.
     Step 3 – “Review summary”
       - Show:
         - How many customers will be added/updated.
         - How many conversations/messages.
         - A couple of sample rows (first 3 customers + first 3 messages).
       - For v1, you can reuse the stats from the importHistory latest response; no need for a separate “preview only” path.
     Step 4 – “Finish”
       - Success message:
         - “Your phone history is now part of ServicePro.”
         - Button to:
           - “Go to Messages”
           - “Go to Customers”

2. Integrate with existing importHistory API:
   - Reuse the `phone_history_imports` log to show:
     - Pending / success / failed.
   - If the import is still running, show a spinner + “Processing… this may take a few minutes” message.

3. Navigation:
   - Add a link under Settings/Administration:
     - “Migration Wizard”
   - On `/admin/import-history`, add a button:
     - “Prefer a guided flow? Use the Migration Wizard” linking to `/admin/migration-wizard`.

4. Design:
   - Use the same glassmorphism / gradient card design used in the Setup Wizard.
   - Each step should feel like a big friendly card, with minimal jargon.

5. No new backend routes are strictly required for v1.
   - Use:
     - GET `/api/admin/import-history/latest`
     - POST `/api/admin/import-history/upload`

Document this in `replit.md` under INT-4 – Migration Wizard (Phone History).
