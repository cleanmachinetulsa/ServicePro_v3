You are editing my ServicePro v3 multi-tenant ServicePro v3 repo.

GOAL:
Fix the remaining code-side warnings reported by `scripts/printCleanMachineReadiness.ts` for the Clean Machine tenant (`tenantId = root`, `tenantSlug = cleanmachine`), WITHOUT breaking any existing behavior.

Do NOT change tests or the readiness CLI path. Keep everything multi-tenant safe.

====================================================
TASK A – Fix conversations recent activity query
====================================================

1. Find the service or helper that powers the "conversations" section of the Tenant Readiness Engine. It will be the code that:
   - Runs a DB query to count recent conversations
   - Returns an item with key like "conversations.recent_activity" or "conversations.recent_activity_query_error"
   - Currently produces a SQL error like: syntax error at or near ">="

2. Fix the SQL or query builder so it correctly checks for "recent" conversations, e.g.:
   - lastMessageAt >= now() - interval '30 days'
   or the equivalent using whatever date helpers we use.
   - Make sure it’s valid for Postgres.

3. Add or update tests so that:
   - The readiness service no longer sets the "recent_activity_query_error" warning.
   - The script `npx tsx scripts/printCleanMachineReadiness.ts --tenantSlug=root --json`
     runs without throwing a SQL error, and includes a proper conversations recent-activity item
     with either pass/warn based on data, not on a query error.

4. Run all existing tests and ensure they pass.

====================================================
TASK B – Make sure the AI industry pack is set for Clean Machine
====================================================

Goal: root / Clean Machine should have an industry pack set to our Auto Detailing / Mobile Auto Detail pack.

1. Find where "industry" is represented:
   - It may be a column on tenants, tenant_settings, tenant_config, or similar, or
   - A relation to an "industry_packs" table or ID.
   - There is also likely a config file such as `shared/industryPacks.ts`, `client/src/config/industryPacks.ts`, or similar.

2. Identify the industry pack that corresponds to my main business: auto detailing / mobile auto detailing (Clean Machine). Use the existing IDs/keys in code – do NOT invent a new industry ID.

3. Ensure that the Clean Machine tenant (`tenantId = root`, `tenantSlug = cleanmachine`) has that industry pack set, using the same mechanism all other tenants would use. This should be done using:
   - Existing migrations/columns, not new schema unless absolutely necessary.
   - Either:
     - A one-time seed/update in a seed script, or
     - A safe update helper that ensures root has an industryId set if missing.

4. After wiring it:
   - Run `npx tsx scripts/printCleanMachineReadiness.ts --tenantSlug=root --json`
   - Confirm that the `ai.industry_configured` item is now a PASS for root.

====================================================
CONSTRAINTS
====================================================

- Do NOT hardcode root-specific behavior in the application logic; any root-specific updates should be in seed/update scripts or very clearly scoped to "initial data migration."
- Do NOT break multi-tenant isolation.
- Do NOT remove or refactor major structures; keep changes minimal and targeted.

====================================================
AFTER YOU FINISH
====================================================

1. Post back in the Replit logs / output:
   - The updated readiness JSON for `tenantSlug=root` (truncated if needed).
   - A short summary of what you changed.

Stop after these tasks – do NOT start new phases.
