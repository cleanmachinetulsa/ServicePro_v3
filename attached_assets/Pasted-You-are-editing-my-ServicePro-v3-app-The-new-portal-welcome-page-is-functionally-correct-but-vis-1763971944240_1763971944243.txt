You are editing my ServicePro v3 app. The new `/portal/welcome` page is functionally correct but visually far below the quality of my `cleanmachinetulsa.com/showcase` page.

Implement **Phase 16.5.1 – Visual Polish & Motion for /portal/welcome**.

GOAL:
Keep all existing data fetching and business logic EXACTLY as-is, but **completely overhaul the UI/UX** of `/portal/welcome` to match or exceed the polish of my Clean Machine showcase page, with:

- Cinematic background (deep gradients + glow)
- True glassmorphism cards (blur, gradient borders, subtle glow)
- Premium buttons (gradient primary, glowing hover, icons)
- Smooth scroll-in animations for sections/cards
- Micro-interactions on hover (scale, shadow, tint)
- Clean typography hierarchy and better spacing

DO NOT:
- Change API routes or backend logic.
- Change loyalty logic, funnels, or links.
- Break multi-tenant behavior (still read config from the welcome-config API).

Only modify:
- The `/portal/welcome` React page/component.
- Shared UI styles/components if needed (e.g. button, card, section wrappers).
- Minimal CSS/utility additions to support glassmorphism/animations.

====================================================
PART 1 – CONFIRM CURRENT STRUCTURE (READ ONLY)
====================================================

1. Locate the file implementing `/portal/welcome`, e.g. something like:
   - `client/src/pages/portal/Welcome.tsx`
   - or whatever route file is mapped to `/portal/welcome`.

2. Confirm:
   - It calls the backend endpoint for portal welcome config (heading, subheading, bullets, tiers, CTAs, trust).
   - It renders sections:
     - Hero with badge + heading + CTAs
     - “How It Works”
     - Tier list
     - Welcome offer
     - Trust section
     - Bottom CTA

You will preserve the **data shape and logic**, but significantly upgrade the visuals and motion.

====================================================
PART 2 – HERO: CINEMATIC, SHOWCASE-LEVEL
====================================================

Overhaul the hero section to feel like my showcase page:

1. BACKGROUND
   - Wrap the **entire /portal/welcome page** in a full-screen gradient container similar to:

     - Background: deep navy → indigo → purple gradient.
     - Optional subtle starfield/noise overlay (if the project already uses a similar asset or CSS).
     - Use `position: relative;` with a couple of absolutely positioned blurred gradient “glow” blobs (e.g. `top-0 left-1/4`, `bottom-0 right-1/3`) behind the content.

   - Do NOT introduce huge image files. Use CSS gradients and blur.

2. HERO LAYOUT
   - Center content in a max width container (e.g. `max-w-5xl` or `max-w-6xl`).
   - Top padding: generous (`py-12 md:py-16 lg:py-20`).
   - Use:

     - Small pill badge at top:
       - Gradient background (blue → purple) with soft glow.
       - Text: `badge` from config.
       - Rounded-full.
     - **Main heading**:
       - Big, bold, white text (`text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl`).
       - Split so the word like “Rewards” is a gradient text span (blue → purple), similar to the gradient word “Detailing Business” on the showcase.
     - **Subheading**:
       - Medium-weight text in a soft white/blue (`text-slate-200` style), using `subheading`.

3. HERO CTAs
   - Use a responsive flex layout:
     - Stack vertically on mobile with gaps.
     - Row on desktop.

   - PRIMARY BUTTON (“Sign In & Claim 500 Points”):
     - Gradient background (blue → violet → pink).
     - Slight glass look (semi-transparent + border + subtle blur if possible).
     - Box shadow with soft glow.
     - Hover:
       - Slight scale up (e.g. 1.03).
       - Stronger glow / gradient shift.
     - Include an icon at the left (use existing icon set: e.g. login/arrow/star).

   - SECONDARY BUTTONS (“Book a Service”, “Buy a Holiday Gift Card”):
     - Dark glass buttons with gradient border and low-opacity inner fill.
     - On hover:
       - Subtle raise + glow.
       - Slight inner gradient tint.
     - Add small icons (calendar for booking, gift for gift card).

   - ALL buttons should feel like the ones on /showcase, not plain black rectangles.

====================================================
PART 3 – GLASS CARDS & SPACING
====================================================

We want everything below the hero to feel like layered glass panels, not flat grey boxes.

Create or reuse a **GlassCard** style (component or CSS pattern):

- Background: semi-transparent dark color (`rgba(15,23,42,0.7)`-like).
- Border: 1px gradient border (blue/purple).
- Border radius: large (`rounded-2xl`).
- Box shadow: soft (no harsh edges, similar to showcase).
- If supported in the project:
  - `backdrop-filter: blur(20px);`
  - CSS fallback for browsers that don’t support it.

Use this look for:

1. “How It Works” step cards.
2. Tier cards.
3. Welcome bonus highlight card.
4. Trust card / section.
5. Bottom CTA container.

Also:

- Increase vertical spacing between sections (e.g. `mt-10 md:mt-16`).
- Use consistent section titles (`h2`, `text-2xl md:text-3xl`, white, bold).

====================================================
PART 4 – HOW IT WORKS SECTION – UPGRADE
====================================================

Enhance the “How It Works” section visually:

1. Section Title:
   - Centered title: “How It Works”.
   - Subtext below explaining in 1–2 sentences.

2. Layout:
   - Use a 1-column layout on small screens.
   - 3-column grid on larger screens.

3. Cards (Step 1/2/3):
   - Each in a GlassCard.
   - Left side: circular icon badge:
     - Solid or gradient background behind icon.
     - Icon from existing library (phone/portal, calendar/gift, sparkles/star).
   - Right side:
     - Step label (“Step 1”, “Step 2”, “Step 3”).
     - Short explainer text.

4. Hover:
   - Slight translateY(-2–4px).
   - Drop shadow increase.
   - Subtle gradient shimmer overlay (optional if simple to implement).

====================================================
PART 5 – REWARD TIERS GRID – PREMIUM PRESENTATION
====================================================

Make the reward tiers look like they belong on a SaaS pricing page:

1. Anchor the section with `id="rewards"` so the “learn more” CTA can scroll here.

2. Section Title:
   - “Reward Tiers”.
   - Subtext: summarizing 1 point per dollar and unlocks.

3. Grid:
   - Map over `tiers` from config.
   - Display each tier as a GlassCard:

     - Top row: pill showing “500 pts”, “1000 pts”, etc.
     - Title: label from config.
     - Optional description line.

4. Visual highlight for the 500 tier:
   - Use a brighter gradient border.
   - Include a small “Great first reward” or “Perfect for welcome bonus” tag.

5. Hover:
   - Same hover interactions as other cards (slight lift, glow, gradient accent).

====================================================
PART 6 – WELCOME BONUS HIGHLIGHT
====================================================

Design a **hero-level card** for the welcome offer:

- Place after tiers.
- Large GlassCard spanning most of the width.

Content:
- Badge: e.g. “Limited-Time Welcome Bonus”.
- “500 Points” callout as big text or strong badge.
- Main copy from `welcomeOffer.label`.
- Fine print from `welcomeOffer.finePrint` in smaller, low-contrast text at bottom.
- A prominent CTA button inside the card:
  - “Sign In & Claim 500 Points” (same style as hero primary, maybe smaller).

Style:
- Slightly different gradient accent behind the card (e.g. radial gradient glow).
- Possibly a subtle animated gradient background if the project already uses CSS animations (do NOT add a large library just for this).

====================================================
PART 7 – TRUST SECTION + BOTTOM CTA – UPGRADE
====================================================

1. TRUST
   - Convert trust info into a clean GlassCard or 2-column layout:
     - Left: icon + heading from `trust.heading`.
     - Right: bullet list from `trust.bullets`.
   - This should look calm and clear, not aggressive.

2. BOTTOM CTA STRIP
   - Full-width but contained card, inspired by the “Ready to see Clean Machine in action?” section on /showcase.
   - Title: e.g. “Ready to Start Earning Points?”.
   - Subtext: one line summarizing steps.
   - Two buttons:
     - Primary: “Sign In & Claim 500 Points” → `/portal/login`.
     - Secondary: “Book a Service” → booking URL.
   - Buttons reuse hero styles for visual consistency.

====================================================
PART 8 – MOTION & INTERACTION
====================================================

Add tasteful motion. Use existing tools:

1. If the project already uses **Framer Motion**:
   - Wrap sections/cards with `motion.div`.
   - On scroll into view:
     - `initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 24 }}`
     - `animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}`
     - `transition={{ duration: 0.4, delay: staggered }}`

2. If Framer is NOT available:
   - Use CSS animations or intersection observer hooks that already exist.
   - At minimum, ensure:
     - Cards fade/slide up slightly when appearing (if simple).
     - Buttons have hover transitions (scale, shadow, gradient shift).

3. Micro-interactions:
   - Buttons: `transition-all` with transform & box-shadow changes.
   - Cards: `transition-transform` and `transition-shadow` with small translateY/scale on hover.

Do not add a new heavy animation dependency if one is not present.

====================================================
PART 9 – RESPONSIVE + ACCESSIBLE
====================================================

- Ensure everything looks excellent on:
  - Small mobile (the most common path from SMS link).
  - Tablet.
  - Desktop.
- Check for:
  - No overlapping content.
  - Adequate padding and section spacing.
  - Large touch targets for buttons.
- Confirm text contrast is good against the gradient background.
- Maintain semantic headings and keyboard-focusable buttons.

====================================================
PART 10 – NO BUSINESS-LOGIC CHANGES
====================================================

- DO NOT alter:
  - How loyalty points work.
  - When/where welcome bonuses are granted or redeemed.
  - Any API endpoints.
- Only adjust UI components and styles for `/portal/welcome` and any shared “presentation-only” components.
- All links (portal login, booking, gift card) must keep working exactly as before.

====================================================
PART 11 – FINAL SANITY CHECK
====================================================

Before finishing, manually confirm:

- [ ] `/portal/welcome` still loads config correctly for the Clean Machine root tenant.
- [ ] Hero looks like a polished marketing hero, not an admin panel.
- [ ] Primary button is gradient + glowing + animated on hover.
- [ ] Secondary buttons are glassy, not flat black boxes.
- [ ] How It Works steps are in glass cards with icons and hover.
- [ ] Reward tiers appear in a premium, responsive grid with highlighted 500-pt tier.
- [ ] Welcome bonus highlight card is visually distinct and attractive.
- [ ] Trust section is clear and reassuring.
- [ ] Bottom CTA strip looks like a real call-to-action, not just text.
- [ ] All new motion/hover effects are smooth and not obnoxious.
- [ ] Mobile view feels clean, readable, and tappable.
