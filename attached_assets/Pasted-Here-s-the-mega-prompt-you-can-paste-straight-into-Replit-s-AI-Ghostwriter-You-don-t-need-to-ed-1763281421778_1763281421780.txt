Here’s the “mega-prompt” you can paste straight into Replit’s AI (Ghostwriter).
You don’t need to edit it – just drop the whole thing in and let it go to town.

⸻


You are an elite front-end engineer, UX/UI designer, and product storyteller building a **triple-A, production-ready showcase page** for my app **Clean Machine**.

This is NOT a generic demo. This is a **flagship marketing + product showcase experience** that:

- Shows off **every major feature** of the Clean Machine app.
- Visually explains some of the **automation logic and rules** behind SMS, email, scheduling, service logic, etc.
- Is polished enough to impress:
  - Friends & family (wow factor).
  - Other service business owners (so they say: “I want this for my business”).
  - Potential partners or future investors.

> IMPORTANT BRAND POSITIONING:
> - Primary focus: **Clean Machine app** — what it does today and what it’s capable of.
> - White-label / “get this for your business” is **ONE contained section** or sub-page, not the whole focus.
> - Do **NOT** mention “ServicePro” anywhere in the UI. If needed, call it “white-label Clean Machine for your business” only.

## TECH + PROJECT ASSUMPTIONS

Assume this project is:

- A React + TypeScript SPA (Vite or CRA).
- Using Tailwind CSS (if Tailwind not present, propose adding it OR use a similar utility class pattern).
- You may add **Framer Motion** or a minimal animation library (or pure CSS) for micro-interactions, but:
  - Keep bundle size reasonable.
  - No cheesy, over-the-top animations. Everything should feel **subtle, premium, intentional**.

If the current repo differs (Next.js, plain React, etc.), **adapt structure & imports accordingly**, but keep the ideas and architecture intact.

---

## BRAND + VISUAL STYLE

Design language: **high-end SaaS for service businesses**, like “Apple x Tesla x Stripe” but for **mobile car detailing & similar service businesses**.

- **Primary Color:** `#1e40af` (Clean Machine blue).
- **Accent Color(s):** rich purple/indigo variants (e.g. `#4c1d95` / `#6366f1`) and soft teal/cyan for highlights.
- **Background:** dark-to-indigo gradients, subtle noise or vignette, **glassmorphism-style** cards.
- **Typography:** modern, clean sans-serif (e.g. `Inter`, `SF Pro`, `Plus Jakarta Sans` or similar).
- **Overall vibe:**
  - Clean, minimal, **NO clutter**.
  - Micro-animations on hover/press.
  - Soft shadows, slight scale, and blur for depth.
  - Visuals should **explain features**, not just decorate.

Accessibility:

- Color contrast must be sufficient.
- Keyboard focus states visible.
- Semantic HTML structure.

---

## PAGE GOAL

Build a **single, premium, long-scroll showcase page** (with internal sections & possibly a few sub-routes if needed) that:

1. Tells a story:
   - _“Here’s what Clean Machine is.”_
   - _“Here’s what it actually does in the real world.”_
   - _“Here’s how it automates your service business.”_
   - _“Here’s why it’s different.”_
2. Shows **interactive previews** of:
   - Booking & scheduling flows.
   - SMS & email automation.
   - Customer dashboard views.
   - Technician / on-site workflow.
3. Includes **one focused section** (or tab) about:
   - “Use this for your own service business” + **14-day free trial CTA**.

---

## INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE / SECTIONS

Create a new top-level page, for example:

- `src/pages/CleanMachineShowcase.tsx`  
  OR (if using a pages router)
- `src/pages/showcase/clean-machine.tsx`

This page should have the following main sections (IDs used for smooth-scroll navigation):

1. `#hero` – **Hero / Overview**
2. `#feature-map` – **Feature Map / Interactive Tabs**
3. `#flows` – **Real-World Flow: From Lead → Repeat Customer**
4. `#automation-logic` – **Logic & Rules Visualized**
5. `#experience` – **UX Highlights: Customer & Technician Experience**
6. `#metrics` – **Business Impact & KPIs**
7. `#whitelabel` – **(Single) White-Label / 14-Day Trial Section**
8. `#faq` – **FAQ & Closing CTA**

Add a **sticky top nav** that highlights the current section and allows smooth scroll to these anchors.

---

## SECTION DETAILS (CONTENT & INTERACTIONS)

### 1. HERO (`#hero`)

Goal: instant clarity and wow.

- Background: dark gradient with a **faint outline of a car**, phone screen mockups, and subtle animated glow.
- Main headline: short, bold line explaining Clean Machine:
  - Example direction: “Clean Machine: The Brain of Your Detailing Business.”
- Subheadline: 1–2 sentences clearly describing:
  - It handles **scheduling, SMS, email, customer history, technician workflows**, etc.
- Primary CTA: “Explore the Clean Machine App”
- Secondary CTA: “See it for Your Business”
- Include a **hero device mock** (simple card UI that looks like a phone or dashboard) with some animated content:
  - e.g., animated “incoming SMS → automated reply → scheduled appointment” loop.
- Microinteractions:
  - CTAs have gradient background with hover state (slight scale + shadow).
  - Hero device mock has a gentle floating animation.

### 2. FEATURE MAP (`#feature-map`)

Goal: show breadth of features, grouped logically.

Implement an **interactive tabbed interface**:

- Feature groups (as tabs / pills across the top):
  - Scheduling & Routing
  - Smart SMS & Email
  - Customer Profiles & Service History
  - Technician / Van Mode
  - Admin Dashboard & Rules

When a user selects a tab:

- Left side: Title, description, bullet list of 4–6 concrete capabilities.
- Right side: **UI preview card(s)** showing a mock of the relevant screens.
  - Use glassy cards with subtle drop shadows & hover effects.
  - Include small animated elements (e.g. highlight the “auto-fill address”, animate a status badge, etc).

Tab transitions:

- Animate with Framer Motion or CSS transitions:
  - Fade + slide for content.
  - Underline slider for active tab.

All feature copy must be **real, rich, descriptive**, aimed at **service business owners** (car detailing, lawn care, cleaning, etc.), no “Lorem ipsum.”

### 3. REAL-WORLD FLOW (`#flows`)

Goal: narratively show how Clean Machine works when a customer contacts the business.

Create a **horizontal stepper / timeline** showing a canonical flow:

1. Customer finds Clean Machine online and submits a request / sends SMS.
2. Clean Machine auto-replies, checks service area, collects details.
3. It proposes time slots based on calendar + location clusters.
4. Appointment is confirmed; technician gets route and prep notes.
5. After the job, customer gets a thank-you + review / upsell message.
6. Customer is added to a **follow-up cadence** (e.g. seasonal reminders).

Interactions:

- Each step is a card with:
  - Step number.
  - Short title.
  - Descriptive copy.
  - Tiny “logic tag” (e.g. “Uses: Service area rules + schedule optimizer”).
- Hover / click reveals a inline mini UI snippet or code-like snippet showing what’s happening under the hood (simple pseudo-code or flow diagram style).
- Use scroll snapping or a horizontal carousel for mobile.

### 4. AUTOMATION LOGIC & RULES (`#automation-logic`)

Goal: surface the “brains” behind the app – logic & rules for SMS, email, scheduling, service limits, etc.

Use **toggleable views** (like tabs within the section) for:

- SMS Flows
- Email Sequences
- Scheduling & Routing Rules
- Rain / Weather Policies
- Service Area & Upsell Logic

For each, display:

- Left: human-readable explanation of the rules:
  - Example: “If customer is >25 minutes outside base radius, send alternate message suggesting a different day or location, or ask for a minimum spend.”
- Right: stylized **pseudo-logic card** (code block-like) or flow chart card showing structured logic.

Example of what to render (for Ghostwriter to elaborate from):

```tsx
const automationRules = [
  {
    id: "sms-flows",
    label: "Smart SMS Flows",
    description:
      "Clean Machine automatically replies to new leads, confirms details, and keeps customers updated without you typing a word.",
    pseudoLogic: [
      "WHEN new_inquiry VIA sms OR form:",
      "  IF number_in_service_area AND open_slots_available:",
      "    SEND 'Thanks for reaching out!' + 2-3 optimized time slots",
      "  ELSE IF just_outside_service_area:",
      "    SEND alternate options message (different day / minimum package)",
      "  ALWAYS:",
      "    Tag conversation with status, vehicle, and location for the dashboard"
    ]
  },
  // ...email sequences, scheduling, rain policy, etc.
];

Render these with syntax-highlight style, but it’s NOT real backend code – it’s illustrative.

Make this section feel like a peek at the control center.

5. EXPERIENCE HIGHLIGHTS (#experience)

Goal: show both Customer Experience and Technician / Owner Experience.

Layout:
	•	Split section with two main columns or tabs:
	•	“For Your Customers”
	•	“For You & Your Team”

For customers, highlight:
	•	Smooth booking (few questions, clear steps).
	•	Confirmations and reminder messages.
	•	Live ETAs / “we’re on the way” messages.
	•	Friendly, on-brand language.

For you & your team, highlight:
	•	A daily “Today’s Schedule” dashboard.
	•	Address + map cards (no real API calls, but visually mimic).
	•	Customer history and notes.
	•	One-tap SMS/email templates.
	•	Rain / weather decision helpers.

Visually:
	•	Use stacked cards showing UI mockups for:
	•	A “Today’s Jobs” technician view.
	•	A customer “Your Upcoming Appointment” SMS / email preview.
	•	Microinteractions on hover: cards gently lift, slight parallax for icons.

6. METRICS & IMPACT (#metrics)

Goal: showcase business impact (even if sample metrics).

Implement metric cards and a simple chart:
	•	Metric cards for:
	•	Time saved per week.
	•	No-show reduction (%).
	•	Repeat booking rate.
	•	Average ticket increase from upsells.
	•	A small, tasteful area/line chart showing “Manual chaos → Clean Machine automation” improvement over time.

Use artificial but plausible numbers and label as “Example results when Clean Machine is fully dialed in.”

7. WHITE-LABEL / TRIAL SECTION (#whitelabel)

This is the ONLY section that speaks to white labeling. It should stay in the background as a “oh, by the way, you can have this too” moment.

Content:
	•	Heading along the lines of:
	•	“Want Clean Machine for Your Service Business?”
	•	Subtext:
	•	“We designed Clean Machine for real-world mobile detailing — but it’s built to power any service business that books jobs, drives to customers, and communicates by text/email.”
	•	Bullet points:
	•	Works for detailing, lawn care, home cleaning, etc.
	•	Fully branded with your logo, colors, and service lists.
	•	Handles your SMS, email, scheduling, follow-ups, and more.
	•	CTA:
	•	“Start a 14-Day Free Trial” button.
	•	Optional secondary CTA: “Book a Walkthrough”

Design:
	•	Brighter card over a darker background.
	•	Subtle “Your Logo Here” illustration (generic logo placeholder).
	•	NO mention of “ServicePro” or internal naming.

8. FAQ & CLOSING CTA (#faq)
	•	5–7 FAQs that service business owners would realistically ask:
	•	“Can it work with my existing phone number?”
	•	“Is it only for car detailing?”
	•	“How hard is it to get started?”
	•	“What if I’m not techy?”
	•	etc.
	•	Each FAQ as an accordion with smooth expand/collapse animation.
	•	Final CTA strip:
	•	Short pitch.
	•	Two buttons: “See the App in Action” (scrolls up to feature map) and “Talk About Using This For My Business” (link to contact).

⸻

INTERACTIONS & ANIMATION REQUIREMENTS
	•	Smooth scroll for in-page navigation.
	•	Section reveal animations on scroll:
	•	E.g. fade + slight upward motion, staggered for cards.
	•	Hover states for:
	•	Buttons: scale + shadow + gradient shift.
	•	Cards: subtle lift and shadow, maybe a border glow.
	•	Tab transitions:
	•	Content fades and slides horizontally.
	•	Active tab indicator bar animates to the new position.
	•	Keep animations snappy and responsive, not slow or distracting.

If using Framer Motion, keep usage focused:
	•	AnimatePresence for tabbed content.
	•	Simple motion.div wrappers for cards.

⸻

COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE

Build a modular component structure, not a monolithic file. Example:

src/
  components/showcase/
    ShowcaseLayout.tsx
    HeroSection.tsx
    FeatureMapSection.tsx
    FlowsSection.tsx
    AutomationLogicSection.tsx
    ExperienceSection.tsx
    MetricsSection.tsx
    WhiteLabelSection.tsx
    FaqSection.tsx
    Shared/
      SectionHeader.tsx
      PillTabs.tsx
      MetricCard.tsx
      CodeCard.tsx
      DeviceMock.tsx
      Timeline.tsx
  pages/
    CleanMachineShowcase.tsx

Make CleanMachineShowcase.tsx just orchestrate the sections:

import HeroSection from "../components/showcase/HeroSection";
import FeatureMapSection from "../components/showcase/FeatureMapSection";
import FlowsSection from "../components/showcase/FlowsSection";
import AutomationLogicSection from "../components/showcase/AutomationLogicSection";
import ExperienceSection from "../components/showcase/ExperienceSection";
import MetricsSection from "../components/showcase/MetricsSection";
import WhiteLabelSection from "../components/showcase/WhiteLabelSection";
import FaqSection from "../components/showcase/FaqSection";

const CleanMachineShowcase: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-slate-950 text-slate-50">
      {/* Sticky nav with anchors */}
      {/* Each section has a unique id for scroll linking */}
      <HeroSection id="hero" />
      <FeatureMapSection id="feature-map" />
      <FlowsSection id="flows" />
      <AutomationLogicSection id="automation-logic" />
      <ExperienceSection id="experience" />
      <MetricsSection id="metrics" />
      <WhiteLabelSection id="whitelabel" />
      <FaqSection id="faq" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default CleanMachineShowcase;

Each section component should:
	•	Accept id prop and set id={id} on the root element.
	•	Use shared sub-components for consistency (headers, pills, etc.).
	•	Read data from local arrays/config objects instead of hardcoding everything inline.

⸻

DESIGN SYSTEM & UTILITIES

Create a minimal design system for reuse:

// SectionHeader.tsx
type SectionHeaderProps = {
  eyebrow?: string;
  title: string;
  subtitle?: string;
  alignment?: "left" | "center";
};

export const SectionHeader: React.FC<SectionHeaderProps> = ({
  eyebrow,
  title,
  subtitle,
  alignment = "left",
}) => (
  <div
    className={`max-w-3xl ${
      alignment === "center" ? "mx-auto text-center" : ""
    } space-y-3`}
  >
    {eyebrow && (
      <p className="text-xs font-semibold tracking-[0.2em] uppercase text-sky-400">
        {eyebrow}
      </p>
    )}
    <h2 className="text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
      {title}
    </h2>
    {subtitle && (
      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
        {subtitle}
      </p>
    )}
  </div>
);

	•	similar small components:

	•	PillTabs (for feature map & automation toggles).
	•	DeviceMock (phone / tablet frame).
	•	CodeCard (for pseudo-logic).
	•	MetricCard, Timeline, etc.

⸻

COPYWRITING REQUIREMENTS

All text must be:
	•	Written for busy service business owners (detailing, lawn care, cleaning, etc.).
	•	Concrete and benefit-driven:
	•	“Fewer no-shows.”
	•	“Automatic reminders.”
	•	“More repeat customers.”
	•	No filler lorem ipsum.
	•	Tone:
	•	Friendly, confident, knowledgeable.
	•	Not corporate, not “bro-marketing.”
	•	Slightly conversational, but still professional.

Describe features Clean Machine has / is aiming for:
	•	Online booking & scheduling.
	•	Smart SMS replies and templates.
	•	Email follow-ups and review requests.
	•	Customer profiles and vehicle/service histories.
	•	Technician “today’s jobs” view.
	•	Intelligent routing and service-area logic.
	•	Rain / weather handling (reschedule workflows).
	•	Upsell recommendations (e.g., coatings, protectants, extras).
	•	White-label option as a bonus, not front and center.

⸻

WHAT I WANT FROM YOU (REPLIT)
	1.	Create all components & sections described above, wired together into a new CleanMachineShowcase page.
	2.	Implement:
	•	Sticky nav.
	•	Smooth scrolling to section anchors.
	•	Tabs with animated content transitions.
	•	Scroll reveal + hover microinteractions.
	3.	Use TailwindCSS (or equivalent utility classes) with the color palette and styles described.
	4.	Use real, polished copy targeted at service business owners.
	5.	Ensure:
	•	Responsive design (great on desktop, tablet, and mobile).
	•	Accessible HTML and contrast.
	•	Clean, organized file structure.

After generating, review your own work and:
	•	Refactor repetitive patterns into reusable components.
	•	Improve naming for clarity.
	•	Ensure the experience feels like a production-ready marketing site I can proudly show to people as the “home” of my app’s capabilities.

Now, based on all of the above, generate the full implementation for this Clean Machine showcase page and all necessary supporting components.
