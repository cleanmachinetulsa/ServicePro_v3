I ran the shell code. Read the code and tell me if it worked

I don't see any shell code execution in the recent console output or workflow logs. The console shows your Express server running normally with regular API requests (mostly /api/users/me authentication checks), but there's no indication of a new shell command being executed.

The most recent notable event in the logs was:

9:27:01 PM [express] POST /api/test-sms 200 in 46ms
This suggests someone tested the SMS endpoint, but I don't see any shell command output.

To help you verify if your shell command worked, I need to know:

What shell command did you run?
What were you trying to accomplish?
If you ran a command in a separate shell/terminal, the output wouldn't appear in the workflow console shown here. You can check:

The Shell tab in Replit for command output
Look for any new files created
Check if any services started/stopped
Review any error messages that appeared
Let me know what command you executed and I can help you determine if it succeeded.
