You are working in the Servicepro-v3-base Replit project.

GOAL
Restore my Clean Machine customer homepage as the default route, while keeping the new ServicePro marketing landing page available at a different path.

DESIRED BEHAVIOR

1) Routes:
   - "/" (root) SHOULD show the Clean Machine booking site (same thing that is currently on "/home").
   - "/home" should continue to work as an alias to the Clean Machine booking site.
   - "/servicepro" should show the new ServicePro marketing landing page that you recently created.
   - The new marketing page at "/" that you added earlier should NO LONGER be the default route.

2) Redirect behavior:
   - Visiting "/" should either:
       a) directly render the same component used for "/home", OR
       b) immediately redirect to "/home" using react-router's <Navigate replace to="/home" />.
   - Pick whichever is cleaner given the current App.tsx structure, but DO NOT break authentication or tenant loading.

3) Buttons / links:
   - On the ServicePro landing page (the marketing page), keep the "Get Started Free" button pointing to the onboarding route (e.g. "/onboarding/industry" or whatever it currently uses).
   - Update the "View Demo Site" button so that it opens my Clean Machine public customer site at "/home" (for now) instead of pointing to a non-working demo route.
   - Make sure any hardcoded links that assumed "/" is the marketing page still work logically after this change.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- The previous change added a LandingPage (or similar) component and wired it to the "/" route in client/src/App.tsx (or wherever routes are defined). 
- You MUST:
   1) Keep the Clean Machine route at "/home" exactly as it is now (same component, same behavior).
   2) Add a route for "/servicepro" that renders the ServicePro marketing LandingPage.
   3) Change the "/" route so it either:
        - renders the same Clean Machine homepage component as "/home", OR
        - uses <Navigate replace to="/home" /> so "/" redirects to "/home".

- Confirm there are no duplicate routes for "/" after your changes.
- Be careful with import changes: if you move the LandingPage component to "/servicepro", ensure the import path is still correct and remove any unused imports.

TESTS TO RUN

After changes, manually or via tests verify:

1) Going to "/" shows the Clean Machine booking homepage.
2) Going to "/home" shows the exact same Clean Machine booking homepage.
3) Going to "/servicepro" shows the ServicePro marketing page.
4) On the ServicePro marketing page:
   - "Get Started Free" still goes to the onboarding/signup flow.
   - "View Demo Site" opens "/home" in a new tab or current tab (either is fine as long as it works).
5) No console errors on navigation between "/", "/home", "/servicepro", and the dashboard.

Please make the routing changes, update any affected links, and then report back exactly what files you changed and how "/" is now wired.
