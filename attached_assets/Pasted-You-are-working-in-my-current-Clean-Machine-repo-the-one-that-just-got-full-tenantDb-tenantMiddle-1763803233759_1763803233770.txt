You are working in my current Clean Machine repo (the one that just got full tenantDb / tenantMiddleware migration and passes all 11 tenant isolation tests).

Treat Phase 1 (tenant isolation) as COMPLETE and DO NOT change tenantDb.ts, tenantMiddleware.ts, or any of the tenant isolation tests unless absolutely necessary.

Your new task is **Phase 2A – Tenant Registry + Simple Admin UI**.

Objectives:

1. TENANT MODEL CONFIRMATION
   - Confirm there is a `tenants` table in `shared/schema.ts` that looks roughly like:
     - id (primary key, string like 'root', 'tenant-xxx')
     - name
     - createdAt
   - Confirm there is a root tenant row in the database (id = 'root') that represents Clean Machine.
   - If the row does NOT exist, create a small migration/seed or startup check to insert root tenant with:
     - id: 'root'
     - name: 'Clean Machine Auto Detail'

2. TENANT CONFIG TABLE (IF NEEDED)
   - Check if we already have a `tenantConfig`-style table.
   - If not, create one in `shared/schema.ts` like:
     - tenantId (FK to tenants.id, primary key)
     - businessName
     - logoUrl
     - primaryColor
     - tier (starter/pro/elite) with default 'starter'
     - createdAt
   - Seed a config row for the root tenant using my current Clean Machine details (business name, etc.) where reasonable.

3. ADMIN BACKEND ENDPOINTS
   - Add minimal admin routes under something like `server/routes.adminTenants.ts` and wire them in `server/routes.ts`:
     - `GET /api/admin/tenants` → returns list of tenants with basic info (id, name, tier, createdAt).
     - `GET /api/admin/tenants/:id` → returns tenant + config details.
     - `POST /api/admin/tenants` → (for now) create a new tenant with:
       - name, tier, and optional basic config. Use safe defaults.
     - For now, authorization can be simple: reuse existing admin auth middleware so only my owner/admin account can hit these endpoints.

   - All queries MUST use `req.tenantDb` or a clean, intentional pattern:
     - For now, tenants table can be accessed with the root/global db if that’s how architect intended.
     - If tenants table is tenant-scoped, then make sure it’s consistent with the tenantDb patterns already in place.

4. SIMPLE ADMIN UI (FRONTEND)
   - Add a new page in the existing React dashboard, something like:
     - Route: `/admin/tenants`
     - Visible only to my admin/user account (reuse existing admin-only UI patterns).
   - This page should:
     - List tenants in a simple table (id, name, tier, createdAt).
     - Have a “View” button that links to `/admin/tenants/:id`.
     - Have a simple “Create Tenant” form (name, tier selects: starter/pro/elite).
   - Add a basic detail view:
     - Route: `/admin/tenants/:id`
     - Show tenant name, tier, createdAt, and any basic config fields (businessName, primaryColor, etc.).
   - Keep styling consistent with the current dashboard: no fancy redesign, just clean and usable.

5. NO BEHAVIOR CHANGE FOR ROOT
   - The existing app behavior for the root tenant (Clean Machine) must remain unchanged:
     - Bookings, SMS, calls, dashboards, etc. should all still work as before.
   - The new admin tenant UI is additive only.

6. TESTING & VERIFICATION
   - After changes:
     - Run: `npx tsc --noEmit`
     - Run: `npx vitest run server/tests/tenantIsolation/tenantDb.test.ts`
     - Run: `npm run dev` (or restart dev server) and confirm:
       - The app still loads.
       - `/admin/tenants` works in the browser.
   - Do NOT introduce any new dependency that isn’t absolutely necessary.

When you’re done, give me a short report:
- What files you created/modified.
- What endpoints now exist.
- How to reach the new `/admin/tenants` UI in the browser.
- Confirm tenant isolation tests still pass.
