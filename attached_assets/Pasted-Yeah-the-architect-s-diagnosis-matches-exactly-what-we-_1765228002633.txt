Yeah, the architect’s diagnosis matches exactly what we thought:

* **Nav links now all point to `/settings/...` → `SettingsWorkspace` → skinny placeholder panels**
* Your **old rich pages live under `/dashboard`, `/admin/...`**, and they’re still there — just not being used.

So:

* ✅ The **high-level plan is correct** (route root → legacy pages, others → new workspace).
* ⚠️ The way it’s phrased is **too vague**.
  “Update all links to old paths” could accidentally make *every* tenant use legacy admin, which we don’t want.

We should **amend the prompt** so it:

1. Only changes behavior for **Clean Machine / root tenant**.
2. Keeps new workspace routes for **all other tenants**.
3. Doesn’t delete or gut any “new” pages — just chooses which ones to *link* to.

## What to do now

Tell the architect to follow the same four tasks, but with these guardrails baked in.

### 🔧 Paste THIS as a follow-up instruction

You can send this **right after** its proposed “Guide users / Update links / Stop fixing paths / Check owner pages” plan:

````text
IMPORTANT REFINEMENT TO YOUR PLAN:

You are correct about the problem and the direction of the fix:
- Root (Clean Machine) should use the legacy admin pages.
- Other tenants should continue to use the new /settings/... workspace pages.

However, DO NOT apply "update all links to old paths" globally.

Instead, do this:

1) TENANT SCOPING
- Use the existing tenant context (tenantId or hostname) to detect Clean Machine:
  - tenantId === 'root' OR hostname contains "cleanmachinetulsa.com".
- All routing overrides MUST be conditional on that check.
- For any tenant that is NOT root, keep the current /settings/... behavior exactly as-is.

2) NAVIGATION LINKS (navigationItems.ts)
- Do NOT hard-overwrite the paths for everyone.
- Introduce a helper function (or equivalent) that picks legacy vs new per tenant:

  ```ts
  import { getCurrentTenantId } from "@/utils/tenantContext"; // or your existing helper

  function cmOrDefault(cmPath: string, defaultPath: string): string {
    const tenantId = getCurrentTenantId();
    return tenantId === "root" ? cmPath : defaultPath;
  }
````

* Then update ONLY the items where we know there is a legacy page:

  Examples (adjust to actual paths you found):

  ```ts
  {
    label: "Dashboard",
    path: cmOrDefault("/dashboard", "/settings/dashboard"),
    ...
  },
  {
    label: "Services",
    path: cmOrDefault("/admin/services", "/settings/operations/services"),
    ...
  },
  {
    label: "SMS Campaigns",
    path: cmOrDefault("/admin/sms-campaigns", "/settings/communications/sms"),
    ...
  },
  {
    label: "Email Templates",
    path: cmOrDefault("/admin/email-templates", "/settings/email"),
    ...
  },
  {
    label: "Rewards",
    path: cmOrDefault("/rewards", "/settings/loyalty"),
    ...
  }
  ```

* The key is: ROOT tenant gets the legacy `/dashboard` + `/admin/...` routes; everyone else stays on `/settings/...`.

3. STOP “FIXING” PATHS FOR ROOT ONLY

* Wherever you previously added auto-normalization or redirects (e.g. SettingsWorkspace, settings-admin wrapper, dashboard route), scope these changes:

  ```ts
  const tenantId = getCurrentTenantId();

  // If root, DO NOT rewrite URLs to /settings/...
  if (tenantId === "root") return;
  ```

* Only non-root tenants should be auto-redirected to normalized /settings/... paths.

4. VERIFICATION (REQUIRED)

* Log in as the root / Clean Machine tenant and verify:

  * Dashboard, Services, SMS Campaigns, Email Templates, Rewards all land on the older rich pages with my existing content.
  * URLs do NOT flap anymore and do NOT auto-redirect back to the skinny workspace panels.
* Also log in as a **non-root** test tenant and confirm:

  * They still use the new /settings/... workspace pages.
  * Their experience is unchanged.

DO NOT delete any workspace components or the new /settings/... routes.
We are only changing:

* Which path nav points to for ROOT vs others.
* Which tenants the normalization logic runs for.

```

### Short answer to your question

> “Do you trust its tact? Shall I set it to work or should we amend our prompt?”

- **Trust the diagnosis and the direction.**  
- **Amend the prompt with the scoping + helper logic above, then let it run.**

That gives you:

- Root = your old, fully-configured Clean Machine dashboard back.
- Other tenants = still get the new workspace system.
- No need to revert the whole repo or lose progress.
