2. Updated SP task list after SP-14
You said: “add this to the current task list to work in after task 14 then we do FULL v2 performance pass.”
So here’s the updated sequence from SP-11 forward:
Already in motion / defined:
* SP-11 – Telephony Modes & routing options
    * Let tenants choose how calls/texts behave (AI-first, human-first, hybrid, etc.) 
* SP-12 – Voicemail UX v2
    * Fix Twilio media auth, make in-app voicemail playback “just work”. 
* SP-13 – Usage & Billing Foundations
    * Normalize how we store usage (SMS, MMS, minutes, emails, AI tokens) per tenant per day. 
* SP-14 – Tenant Billing Portal v1
    * Let ServicePro customers:
        * See plan, next bill date, base price 
        * See high-level usage summary 
        * Manage card on file / invoices 
        * Cancel at end of period 
Now, inserted after SP-14, per your list:
SP-15 – Full Usage Metering Integration (Twilio / OpenAI / SendGrid)
* Pull real usage from:
    * Twilio (messages, minutes) 
    * OpenAI (tokens, calls) 
    * SendGrid (emails) 
* Map it into our internal tenant_usage tables. 
* Make sure everything is multi-tenant safe and summarized on one usage timeline. 
SP-16 – Billing v2: Usage Billing + Dunning & Auto Suspension
* Define pricing formulas per tier. 
* Compute monthly bill = base plan + usage add-ons. 
* Integrate with Stripe (or equivalent) to:
    * Generate invoices 
    * Charge automatically 
* Add dunning:
    * Reminders (email/SMS) before/after failed payments 
    * Grace period 
    * Auto-suspend tenant telephony + AI if they don’t pay 
* Clear “account suspended, here’s why” UX for tenants. 
SP-17 – Simple vs Advanced Dashboard Mode
* Per-user or per-tenant uiMode = 'simple' | 'advanced'. 
* Simple mode:
    * Hides scary / optional config pages. 
    * Uses non-technical language. 
    * Emphasizes “Do these 3 things to go live”. 
* Advanced mode:
    * Shows all tuning knobs, logs, raw usage graphs, deep config. 
SP-18 – Full Spanish Support v1 (Foundation)
* Centralize all UI strings into i18n (EN + ES). 
* Add a language selector:
    * App UI language 
    * Preferred customer-facing language (for default copy). 
* Make sure key flows (booking, rewards, support AI system messages) respect language. 
* Prepare infrastructure so we can add more language packs later (Ukrainian, Dari, Pashto, etc.) as future tasks. 
SP-19 – Loyalty Identity Hardening v2 (OTP)
* Put this on the REVISIT LIST as you said, but after the above:
    * Add optional “verify by SMS code” before:
        * Applying big redemptions 
        * Changing phone number for an account 
* Make it configurable:
    * Off by default 
    * Recommended for higher tiers or large point banks. 
SP-20 – Add-on System for Upsells
* Define “features” separate from base plan:
    * e.g. Extra phone number, extra AI seats, advanced analytics, extra SMS pack. 
* UI:
    * “Add Features” panel where tenants can toggle add-ons. 
* Tie into billing:
    * Add-on price added to monthly bill automatically. 
SP-21 – Demo Sandbox Mode v2 (Fix current broken demo)
* Create a Demo Tenant with:
    * Fake customers, jobs, messages, rewards, etc. 
* Lock down outbound messaging:
    * Only to a single test number the user enters. 
    * 2-step confirmation before sending. 
* Make sure:
    * No access to root tenant data (Clean Machine). 
    * The demo UI shows setup wizard / telephony / A2P / rewards / support AI as if it were live, but all backed by demo data. 
SP-22 – Full v2 Performance Pass
* Do a real perf audit:
    * Client load times, bundle sizes, API latency, DB indices, N+1 queries. 
* Fix:
    * Slow pages (messages, dashboard, booking) 
    * Any obvious backend bottlenecks. 
* Aim to make the app feel snappy on a mid-range phone + average connection, not just “ok in dev”. 
That gets you:
* Clean CM v1 
* SP core v1 
* Then deep v2 polish on billing, usage, UX, languages, demo, and performance
