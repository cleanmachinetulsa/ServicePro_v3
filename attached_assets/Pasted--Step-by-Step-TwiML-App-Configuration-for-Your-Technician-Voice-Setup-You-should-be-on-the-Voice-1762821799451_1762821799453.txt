🧭 Step-by-Step: TwiML App Configuration for Your Technician Voice Setup

You should be on the Voice Configuration tab (the second screenshot you sent).
That’s the correct section for Twilio Voice JS SDK use.
Ignore the Messaging Configuration tab — you don’t need that one at all.

✅ 1. “Voice Configuration → Request URL”

This is the endpoint Twilio calls when your iPad browser client places a call.

👉 Enter:

https://clean-machine-chatbot-cleanmachinetul.replit.app/twiml/voice


(Exactly as shown in your screenshot — looks perfect!)
This must match your Express route that responds with TwiML (the one we wrote as:
server/routes/twiml-voice.ts).

If you haven’t added that route yet, you can paste this code in Replit:

import { Router } from "express";
import twilio from "twilio";
const router = Router();

router.post("/twiml/voice", (req, res) => {
  const twiml = new twilio.twiml.VoiceResponse();
  const to = req.body.To;
  if (to) {
    const dial = twiml.dial({ callerId: process.env.TWILIO_CALLER_ID_NUMBER });
    dial.number({}, to);
  } else {
    twiml.say("No destination number provided.");
  }
  res.type("text/xml").send(twiml.toString());
});

export default router;


Then mount it in your server file:

import twimlVoiceRouter from "./routes/twiml-voice.js";
app.use("/", twimlVoiceRouter);

✅ 2. “Request Method”

Keep it on:

HTTP POST


Twilio will send call data (like To, From, CallSid) in POST form data — so POST is correct.

⚙️ 3. Optional Settings (Fallback URL, Status Callback URL)

You can safely leave these blank for now, but here’s what they’re for in the future:

Field	Purpose	Fill in Later When
Fallback URL	Twilio will use this if your main Voice URL fails.	Optional—add once you have a backup route.
Status Callback URL	Twilio sends call progress events here (ringing, answered, completed).	Add later if you want call analytics or to update job status automatically.

So right now:

Leave them blank.

Leave methods as POST (default).

✅ 4. “Caller Name Lookup”

Leave it as:

Disabled


It’s not necessary for your use case and just adds cost per lookup.

✅ 5. “Allow Application Dialing from Other Twilio Accounts”

Leave it unchecked (default).

That’s only needed if you’re sharing this TwiML App across multiple Twilio sub-accounts.

✅ 6. Click “Create”

After clicking Create, you’ll be taken back to the TwiML Apps list.
Copy your new App SID (starts with AP…) — that’s your:

TWILIO_VOICE_TWIML_APP_SID


Add it to your Replit .env:

TWILIO_VOICE_TWIML_APP_SID=APxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

✅ Recap of the Correct Values
Field	Value
Request URL	https://clean-machine-chatbot-cleanmachinetul.replit.app/twiml/voice
Request Method	HTTP POST
Fallback URL	(leave blank)
Status Callback URL	(leave blank)
Caller Name Lookup	Disabled
Allow Application Dialing…	Unchecked

Then click Create.

🎯 Next Step

Once that’s created, go to your Replit project’s .env and make sure you have this full set:

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=AC4002a2c9479bb0d1468d9353d53fe3fe
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=••••••••••••••
TWILIO_VOICE_API_KEY_SID=SK93705655d91653c54f5a5bddc853f7d3
TWILIO_VOICE_API_KEY_SECRET=••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
TWILIO_VOICE_TWIML_APP_SID=APxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_CALLER_ID_NUMBER=+1XXXXXXXXXX


After that, your Twilio Voice SDK setup will be complete — ready for the /api/voice/token endpoint to issue access tokens to your technician app.
