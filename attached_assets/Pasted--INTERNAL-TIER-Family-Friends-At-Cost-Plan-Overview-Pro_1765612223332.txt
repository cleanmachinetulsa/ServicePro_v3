# INTERNAL TIER (Family / Friends / At-Cost Plan)

## Overview
Provide select tenants (family, friends, partners, internal demo tenants) with full platform access but with:
- No subscription fee
- No markup
- All usage billed to the platform owner (Jody)
- All features unlocked without restriction

This gives “at-cost” access: the tenant only incurs raw usage costs (SMS, voice, AI) which the platform absorbs.

## Implementation

### 1. Schema Update – Add 'internal' Tier
Extend planTier enum:

starter | pro | elite | internal

For internal tenants:
- planTier = 'internal'
- status = 'active' (no Stripe subscription required)

### 2. Feature Map
Add TIER_FEATURES.internal with everything unlocked:

{
  aiSmsAgent: true,
  aiVoiceAgent: true,
  dedicatedNumber: true,
  campaigns: true,
  dataExport: true,
  websiteGenerator: true
}

### 3. Billing Logic
Modify billing/subscription checks:

If tenant.planTier === 'internal':
  - Skip Stripe subscription creation
  - Skip payment enforcement
  - Disable “update card” and “upgrade” UI for this tenant
  - Mark tenant visually as INTERNAL in admin dashboard

### 4. Usage Billing
All usage (SMS/calls/OpenAI/SendGrid) is billed to the platform super-tenant account.

No changes required — this behavior is already native.

### 5. Admin UI Additions
In /admin/tenants:
- Add INTERNAL badge (distinct style)
- Remove or gray-out billing fields for internal tenants
- Allow selecting “Internal” when creating/editing tenants (owner-only)

### 6. Support & Concierge Implications
Internal tenants automatically receive:
- Highest-level AI agents (SMS + voice)
- Full telephony support
- All industry packs
- All website templates
- Concierge setup included by default

This becomes your “family/friends at-cost” tier.

📍 WHERE THIS FITS IN THE BUILD PLAN
It should be inserted into your MASTER_PLAN_v3.2.md after Phase 7 and before Phase 8, because:
* Phase 7 is “Billing, Plans, Status, Stripe” 
* That’s the place where adding an “Internal Tier” makes the most sense 
* Phase 8 (“Industry Packs & Auto-Setup”) is a different layer and shouldn’t get mixed with billing logic 
So it belongs as a new section:

📄 EXACT POSITION IN FILE
Search for this header:

## 7. PHASE 7 – TIERS, BILLING, AND PLAN FEATURES
Then scroll until the section ends.
In the current v3.2 format, Phase 7 ends around line ~820–830 (depending on spacing).
Insert the Internal Tier block immediately after Phase 7 and before Phase 8.
So it becomes:

## 7. PHASE 7 – TIERS, BILLING, AND PLAN FEATURES
   (existing content...)

--- INSERT INTERNAL TIER SNIPPET HERE ---

## 8. PHASE 8 – INDUSTRY PACKS & AUTO-SETUP
If you want the exact line number once your file is in place, you can paste your MASTER_PLAN_v3.2.md into a message, and I’ll tell you the exact line to insert.
