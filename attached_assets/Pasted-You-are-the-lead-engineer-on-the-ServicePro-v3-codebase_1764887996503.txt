You are the lead engineer on the ServicePro v3 codebase. I need you to implement a **tenant-facing A2P Campaign Assistant** so that each tenant can self-file their SMS A2P campaign with AI assistance.

High-level goals:

- Tenant goes to `/settings/a2p` (or similar).
- They see a wizard-style form that collects:
  - Business details (pre-filled from tenant config).
  - Use case / campaign type.
  - Sample messages.
  - Compliance details (opt-in / opt-out language).
- An AI helper button auto-generates good, compliant copy for them based on:
  - Their industry (industry pack).
  - Their existing SMS templates / FAQ / website content.
- Data is saved per-tenant in the database.
- For now, we **do NOT** actually call Twilio TrustHub; just store a "campaign draft" and show “Ready to file” so I can manually submit to Twilio later.

Please implement the following:

1) Database: `a2p_campaigns` table

Create a migration for a new table `a2p_campaigns` with at least:

- id (PK)
- tenant_id (FK)
- status: enum or text (`'draft' | 'ready_to_submit' | 'submitted' | 'approved' | 'rejected'`)
- brand_name: text
- website_url: text
- use_case_category: text   // e.g., 'appointment_notifications', 'marketing', etc.
- campaign_description: text
- sample_messages: jsonb    // array of strings
- opt_in_description: text
- opt_out_instructions: text
- help_instructions: text   // what "HELP" replies do
- message_frequency: text   // e.g., '1-2 per month'
- terms_url: text
- privacy_url: text
- ai_generated: boolean     // if last edit came from AI helper
- last_submitted_at: timestamp nullable
- created_at, updated_at: timestamps

Enforce tenant scoping (tenant_id + unique constraint so each tenant has at most 1 active campaign row).

2) Backend service: `a2pCampaignService`

Create `server/services/a2pCampaignService.ts` with helpers:

- `getCampaignForTenant(tenantId)`
- `upsertCampaignForTenant(tenantId, payload)` with safety checks.
- `markStatus(tenantId, status)` – only valid transitions (e.g., draft → ready_to_submit → submitted).

3) API routes (tenant-scoped)

Create a new routes file `server/routes.a2pCampaign.ts` and register it in `server/routes.ts`. Endpoints:

- `GET /api/a2p/campaign`  
  → returns the current tenant's campaign draft (or sensible defaults).

- `PUT /api/a2p/campaign`  
  → updates the campaign fields for the current tenant.  
  - Validate required fields.
  - Ensure the campaign belongs to the authenticated tenant.

- `POST /api/a2p/campaign/ai-suggest`  
  → calls OpenAI (or the existing AI helper) to generate:
    - campaign_description
    - sample_messages (2–4 examples)
    - opt_in_description
    - opt_out_instructions
    - help_instructions
    - message_frequency
  based on:
    - tenant industry
    - tenant name
    - a few of the tenant’s existing SMS templates / FAQ entries if available.

  This endpoint should:
  - Return proposed fields in a JSON object.
  - NOT overwrite the DB automatically; the frontend will let the user review/accept.

DO NOT call Twilio TrustHub APIs yet. For now, this is just an internal campaign draft + AI helper.

4) Frontend page: `/settings/a2p` (tenant UI)

Create a new page component (e.g. `client/src/pages/SettingsA2P.tsx`) and add a route in the app router, linked from the settings sidebar (“SMS Compliance” or “A2P Campaign”).

The UI should:

- Load existing campaign via `GET /api/a2p/campaign`.
- Show a multi-section form:

  Section 1 – Business & Brand
  - Brand Name (prefill from tenant / business name)
  - Website URL (prefill from tenant config if available)
  - Industry / Use Case Category (dropdown, prefilled based on industry pack)

  Section 2 – Campaign Description & Use Case
  - Textarea for campaign description.
  - Dropdown for high-level use case (transactional, marketing, mixed).
  - AI helper button: “Suggest Description & Use Case”.

  Section 3 – Sample Messages
  - 3–4 multiline fields or a dynamic list to hold sample messages.
  - AI button: “Generate Sample Messages from my real SMS templates”.

  Section 4 – Compliance Details
  - Opt-in description (how customers join).
  - Opt-out instructions (must mention “Reply STOP to unsubscribe”).
  - Help instructions (what happens when they reply HELP).
  - Message frequency.
  - Terms URL / Privacy URL (prefill from tenant config if we have them; otherwise from ServicePro defaults).

- At the top or bottom, show a **status pill**:
  - `Draft / Ready to Submit / Submitted / Approved / Rejected`.

- Buttons:
  - “Save Draft” → PUT /api/a2p/campaign.
  - “Mark Ready to Submit” → POST to mark status `ready_to_submit`.
  - (In future we’ll add “Submit to Twilio”; leave a TODO).

5) AI helper behavior

Use the existing OpenAI integration (the same one used for voicemail summaries) to implement the `ai-suggest` endpoint:

- System prompt should be focused on:
  - US A2P / carrier rules.
  - No SHAFT content.
  - Always include opt-out language like: “Reply STOP to unsubscribe, HELP for help.”
  - Tone: professional, clear, non-spammy.
- Use inputs:
  - tenant business name
  - industry
  - example services / prices if available
  - existing SMS templates (if any) from this tenant

Return proposed fields as:

```json
{
  "campaign_description": "...",
  "sample_messages": ["...", "..."],
  "opt_in_description": "...",
  "opt_out_instructions": "...",
  "help_instructions": "...",
  "message_frequency": "1-2 messages per month"
}
Multi-tenant safety

All DB operations must be tenant-scoped.

Admins of one tenant must not see or modify another tenant’s A2P campaign.

The existing wrapTenantDb / tenant resolution logic must be reused.

UX polish

Mobile-first responsive layout, consistent with other settings pages.

Show small helper tooltips explaining:

What A2P is.

Why opt-out language is required.

That “Ready to Submit” means I (the platform owner) can now review/submit to Twilio.

Final output

After implementation, run through:

Create a brand new tenant via onboarding.

Log in as that tenant.

Visit /settings/a2p.

Use AI helper to populate fields.

Save draft, mark as Ready to Submit.

Confirm DB row is created and scoped to that tenant.

Then respond with a short “How to use the A2P Campaign Assistant” guide for the app owner.
