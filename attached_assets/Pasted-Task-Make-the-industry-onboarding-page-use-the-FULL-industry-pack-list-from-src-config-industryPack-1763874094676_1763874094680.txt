Task: Make the industry onboarding page use the FULL industry pack list from src/config/industryPacks.ts so all 20 industries show up (including Hair Stylist / Barber, etc.), instead of the smaller hard-coded list.

Project: Servicepro app (Servicepro-v3-base)

Working style:
- I (the user) will NOT edit files manually.
- You must do all file edits yourself.
- I will only paste this prompt and run the agent.
- At the end, show me a clear summary of what changed.

Goal:
- The industry selection UI at /admin/onboarding-industry should:
  - Use src/config/industryPacks.ts as the single source of truth for all industries.
  - Display ALL configured industries (roughly 20), including things like Hair Stylist / Barber, HVAC, Junk Removal, etc.
  - Still treat “Photography & Media Studio” as the mega-pack with sub-toggles.
- Remove the duplicated “mini list” that currently limits the UI to ~11 industries.

Steps:

1) Locate the industry config file
----------------------------------
1. Find and open: src/config/industryPacks.ts
2. Inspect how industries are defined there:
   - Is it an array of objects like { id, name, category, … }?
   - Is there a field for “photography” and, if so, does it include sub-packs?

This file is the source of truth. Do NOT reduce or trim industries here. We want ALL of them.

2) Locate the onboarding page that currently hard-codes INDUSTRIES
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Find the React page for the industry onboarding screen, likely at:
   - src/pages/OnboardingIndustry.tsx
   OR
   - client/src/pages/OnboardingIndustry.tsx
2. Open that file and confirm:
   - There is a local constant like `const INDUSTRIES = [...]` with ~11 entries.
   - It currently maps over `INDUSTRIES` to render cards.

This local `INDUSTRIES` array is the problem. It’s duplicating and limiting the list.

3) Make src/config/industryPacks.ts the source of truth
-------------------------------------------------------
1. In the onboarding page file, REMOVE or stop using the local hard-coded `INDUSTRIES` array.
2. Instead, IMPORT the industry pack config from src/config/industryPacks.ts.

For example (adjust to match the actual export in that file):

   import { industryPacks } from "@/config/industryPacks";

or

   import industries from "@/config/industryPacks";

Use the actual export name that src/config/industryPacks.ts defines.

3. Adapt the UI code so that it uses the imported data structure, e.g.:

   - If the config is an array of objects:
     - Map over that array to render each industry card.
   - If it has categories or grouping, you can still flatten it or group it visually, but the important part is:
     - EVERY industry that is “active” / meant to be selectable shows up as a card.

4) Preserve special treatment for Photography mega-pack
-------------------------------------------------------
The current UI has special handling for “Photography & Media Studio”:

- When `selectedIndustry === "photography"`, it shows photography sub-pack toggles (Portrait, Weddings, Events, Real Estate, etc.).

We want to KEEP that behavior.

Update logic as follows:

1. Identify the photography pack from the imported config:
   - e.g., by id like "photography" or by some type/category field.
2. Continue using the existing PHOTOGRAPHY_SUBPACKS constant for now **UNLESS** src/config/industryPacks.ts already defines a list of sub-services or sub-packs for photography.
   - If the config already includes photography sub-pack data, you MAY use that instead of PHOTOGRAPHY_SUBPACKS, but do not remove functionality:
     - Keep the toggles,
     - Keep the featureFlags behavior (`photography:SubName` → boolean).

In other words:
- All industries come from src/config/industryPacks.ts.
- Photography still shows the extra toggles we already built.

5) Ensure the payload to /api/onboarding/industry is unchanged logically
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The POST request to /api/onboarding/industry should still send:

- industryId
- industryName
- featureFlags (including photography:SubName flags if photography is selected)
- rawSelection (containing whatever the current UI captures)

Only the source of the list (the choices shown in the grid) should change.
Do NOT change the endpoint URL or break the shape of the payload, because Phase 8C persistence is already wired to that.

6) Keep UX and styling intact
-----------------------------
- Do NOT change overall layout (cards, grid, header, etc.).
- Only change where the data comes from and how many industries are rendered.
- Make sure selection highlighting (isSelected) still works with the new data source.

7) Basic validation
-------------------
1. After changes, restart the dev server.
2. Load /admin/onboarding-industry.
3. Confirm:
   - You can see ALL industries defined in src/config/industryPacks.ts (approximately 20).
   - “Photography & Media Studio” is present and still shows its sub-pack toggles.
   - Clicking “Save & Continue” still successfully calls /api/onboarding/industry with a valid payload and receives a success response.

8) Report back
--------------
When you are done, please provide:

1. A list of files you changed:
   - e.g., src/pages/OnboardingIndustry.tsx
   - e.g., any small tweaks to src/config/industryPacks.ts if needed (but do NOT remove packs).
2. A short explanation of:
   - How the onboarding page now imports and uses the industry pack config.
   - How you preserved the special case for photography sub-toggles.
3. Confirmation that:
   - All industries from src/config/industryPacks.ts are now visible in the UI.
   - The /api/onboarding/industry request payload remains compatible with Phase 8C.
