you kep psaying these things are in the dash when they arent or are on the hompage when they arent. makes me think were stilll having cache issues despite that i thought we did something to prevent that going foward? like the'book now' button is still there aven though you just said you removed it.. so.. get my concern?

we need to add ALL of those to-dos to the task list and cmoplete them all in whichever order ensures they all get done quiclcy.

AGIAN... i need to be able to acces any pages through the dash somehow, ill never rmemeber all your little custom urls and pages without some way to acces them from the dash. so yeah duh i need a tab in the setting panel or whatever to configure that, lik everything else i ve asked ou to build here so get iwth the program.. what else is not connected to the dash? pages? settings? widgets? anything else i MAY want to acces??

we nned an empoyee onboarding proescess for new employees to get all set up  iwth their account here on the webapp. that could be awsome if build well. give me what would be your plan to implement that, but dont do it. im gonna run it by chat gpt and come back later with a better prompt to build it out.

why does it say couldnt load photo gallery? that definatly needs fixed. unless it just cause i havent connected my google photos or drive url yet? i feel like it should work like that unless you have a better plan.
