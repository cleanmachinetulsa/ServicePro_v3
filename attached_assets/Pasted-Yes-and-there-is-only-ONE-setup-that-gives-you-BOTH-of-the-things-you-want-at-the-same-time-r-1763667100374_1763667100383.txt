Yes — and **there is only ONE setup that gives you BOTH of the things you want at the same time**, reliably, on your Samsung dialer:

### ✅ 1. Real customer caller ID on screen

**AND**

### ✅ 2. A special ringtone + label that only fires for business calls

(even though the calls come through the built-in phone app)

This is **NOT possible** with call forwarding alone.
It **IS possible** with a SIP line registered on your Samsung phone.

Let me break this down in the clearest possible way:

---

# 🌟 THE EXACT SETUP YOU’RE THINKING OF

**Samsung Native Phone App**
→ **Shows real caller number**
→ **Uses a special ringtone**
→ **Shows a custom line name (like “Clean Machine”)**
→ **Does NOT mess with your personal calls**
→ **Does NOT require a VoIP app**

The setup path is:

> **Twilio number → TwiML `<Dial><Sip>` → Twilio SIP Domain → Samsung SIP Client → Your Phone**

When the phone rings:

* You see **the real customer’s phone number**
* Your phone knows “this is coming through the SIP line,” so it plays your **special ringtone**
* The line name appears as **“Clean Machine Line”**
* Scam calls to your personal AT&T number **don’t trigger that ringtone**, so you instantly know the difference

### 🎯 That is exactly the experience you said you wanted.

Nothing else can combine all three needs:

### ❌ Call Forwarding

* Can sometimes show caller ID
* But **cannot** trigger a unique ringtone
* Cannot label the line
* Gets mixed with scams
* Your carrier does weird caller ID things

### ❌ Twilio mobile app

* Won’t use Samsung’s native ring system
* No clean “line label”
* Not the experience you want

### ❌ Google Voice, Sideline, etc.

* All use app-based calling
* No native ringtones
* No true caller ID passthrough
* Not future-proof for your planned IVR + agent

### ✅ SIP with Twilio

✔️ Passes caller ID cleanly
✔️ Lets Samsung treat it as a separate line
✔️ Lets Samsung assign a unique ringtone
✔️ Lets you add a label like “Clean Machine (Twilio)”
✔️ Gives you professional carrier-grade quality
✔️ Works with your IVR and voice agent long-term

# 🧩 WHAT WE HAVEN’T DONE YET

**We have NOT actually set up your SIP Domain or SIP User yet**, and that is the missing link.

This is why your phone is still ringing through forwarding instead of as a dedicated “business line” with tags and ringtones.

Once we finish the SIP setup steps, your phone will behave exactly the way you described.

---

# 🔥 ACTION PLAN (SUPER SIMPLE)

Here’s what we need to finish:

---

## 📌 STEP 1 — Create a SIP Domain in Twilio

**Console → Voice → SIP Domains → Create New**

Use:
`sip.cleanmachinetulsa.com`
(or I’ll help you name it cleanly)

---

## 📌 STEP 2 — Create SIP Credentials

Make a credential list:

* Username: `jody`
* Password: (we'll generate a strong one)
* Add to the SIP domain

---

## 📌 STEP 3 — Update your Twilio number’s voice URL

Replace forwarding with:

```xml
<Response>
  <Dial callerId="${customer_number}">
    <Sip>jody@sip.cleanmachinetulsa.com</Sip>
  </Dial>
</Response>
```

(This is what preserves caller ID AND tells Samsung “this call belongs to the SIP line.”)

---

## 📌 STEP 4 — Add SIP account to your Samsung Phone

On Samsung:

**Settings → Connections → More Connection Settings → Internet Calling (SIP)**

Add:

```
Username: jody
Password: (the one we made)
Domain: sip.cleanmachinetulsa.com
```

Turn ON:

✔ **Receive calls**
✔ **Use for incoming only** (optional)

---

## 📌 STEP 5 — Assign special ringtone

Samsung will now show:

**“Clean Machine SIP Line”**
(or whatever label you choose)

Go to:

**Contacts → SIP Account → Ringtone**

Set something like:

🔔 *“Business Call – Clean Machine”*
or any unique sound you want.

Now ONLY SIP calls ring with this tone.

---

# 🌟 RESULT (WHAT YOU WANT)

When a customer calls your Twilio number:

* Your Samsung rings using the **special business ringtone**
* The call shows **the real customer caller ID**
* The line label says:

> **Clean Machine SIP Line**

* Scam calls to your personal number DO NOT use that ringtone
* You instantly know whether to answer

This is EXACTLY what we designed earlier.
