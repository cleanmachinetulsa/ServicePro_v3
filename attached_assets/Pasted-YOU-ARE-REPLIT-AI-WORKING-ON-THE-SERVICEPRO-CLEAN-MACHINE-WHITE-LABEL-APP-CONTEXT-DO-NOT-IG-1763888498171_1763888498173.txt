YOU ARE REPLIT AI WORKING ON THE "SERVICEPRO" / "CLEAN MACHINE" WHITE-LABEL APP.

CONTEXT (DO NOT IGNORE):
- The dashboard UI was originally built in the Clean Machine app and had carefully tuned:
  - animated transitions
  - hamburger menus
  - layout sizing for buttons and cards
- After migrating into ServicePro, the dashboard NOW:
  - visually looks similar to the old one
  - BUT there is a large block / overlay covering it
  - I cannot click any buttons or interact with the underlying UI.
- I can reach the dashboard by going to /dashboard, but it’s effectively unusable because of the overlay.

GOAL
Find and fix whatever is BLOCKING the dashboard interactivity (likely a full-screen overlay, tour, or welcome block), WITHOUT breaking:
- existing animations and transitions
- base layout and styling
- any of the new dashboard tour logic we just added (Phase 9)

LIMIT SCOPE
- Only touch components/layouts directly related to the main dashboard screen and any overlays/tours that render on top of it.
- Do NOT alter global auth, onboarding endpoints, or tenant creation logic.
- Do NOT redesign the dashboard; only remove/fix the blocker so the underlying dashboard is usable again.

========================
STEP 1 – FIND THE OVERLAY / BLOCK
========================
1) Look in the client for the dashboard page and related components:
   - e.g. files like:
     - client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
     - client/src/components/dashboard/*
     - any “DashboardTour”, “OnboardingOverlay”, or “Welcome” components.

2) SEARCH for:
   - elements with Tailwind classes like:
     - `fixed inset-0`
     - `absolute inset-0`
     - `z-40`, `z-50`, `z-[9999]`
   - components that conditionally render over the entire screen:
     - tours, welcome overlays, “no tenant” overlays, etc.

3) Identify which element is actually covering the dashboard:
   - A component that wraps the whole viewport,
   - Or a div that conditionally renders and takes the full width/height.

========================
STEP 2 – MAKE THE OVERLAY BEHAVE CORRECTLY
========================
When you find the offending overlay/blocker:

1) Determine its INTENDED behavior:
   - Is it a first-time dashboard tour overlay?
   - A “no tenant configured” message?
   - A loading state while fetching data?
   - An onboarding prompt?

2) FIX ITS CONDITIONS so that:
   - It ONLY shows when it actually should:
     - e.g. first visit and hasn’t dismissed the tour,
     - or when there truly is no tenant or no data.
   - It is DISMISSIBLE (when appropriate) via:
     - a close button,
     - or finishing the tour,
     - or successful data load.

3) ENSURE that when it’s NOT supposed to show:
   - It is NOT rendered, OR
   - It renders in a smaller area (e.g. a card **within** the dashboard, not covering everything).

4) Do NOT remove the dashboard tour logic; instead:
   - Confirm that the tour overlay has a clear “finished/dismissed” state,
   - That state is stored (e.g. in local storage or user settings),
   - And once finished, the overlay does not appear again.

========================
STEP 3 – PRESERVE ORIGINAL DASHBOARD FEEL
========================
1) DO NOT:
   - Remove the animated transitions system.
   - Flatten the layout.
   - Strip the hamburger menu or nav structure.

2) If you have to adjust z-index values:
   - Use the minimal change necessary so the dashboard remains visible & clickable.
   - Ensure components that truly should be on top (modals, menus) still work when active.

========================
STEP 4 – VERIFY INTERACTIVITY
========================
After your changes:

1) Confirm that:
   - When visiting /dashboard as a logged-in user:
     - The main dashboard is fully visible.
     - Buttons, cards, and hamburger menus are clickable.
   - The big blocking overlay is gone EXCEPT in cases where it is truly needed (e.g., an intentional tour or modal).

2) If there is a first-time tour:
   - Verify it can be dismissed/completed.
   - After it’s dismissed, reload /dashboard and ensure the tour does NOT block the screen again.

========================
STEP 5 – SUMMARY
========================
At the end, log a short summary describing:
- Which file(s) contained the blocking overlay.
- What conditions/state you used to control its visibility.
- Any z-index or layout changes made.
- Confirmation that the dashboard is now usable and the tour/overlays behave as intended.
