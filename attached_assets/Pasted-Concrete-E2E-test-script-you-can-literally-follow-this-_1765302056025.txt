Concrete E2E test script (you can literally follow this list)

I’ll assume:

Custom domain: https://cleanmachinetulsa.com

Root tenant = Clean Machine

You’re logged in as your main owner account in one browser, and using incognito as a fake customer.

1. Booking + SMS + Email confirmation

Goal: Customer can book online, you get the job, they get SMS + email.

Incognito window → customer side

Go to your main booking entry (/book or whatever the Clean Machine homepage “Book Now” button links to).

Book a test job under a fake name & your real email/phone (so you receive the messages).

Check SMS

You should get a booking confirmation SMS as defined in your templates.

Check Email

You should get a booking confirmation email:

From name: “Clean Machine Auto Detail”

Reply-To: info@cleanmachinetulsa.com

Sender might be notify@servicepro.app or similar—that’s fine as long as it’s consistent.

Back office

Log into the admin dashboard.

Verify the job appears in:

Today / upcoming jobs list

Conversation / customer history if you already link those.

If email fails here: that’s the first place we fix.

2. Missed call + voicemail + smart SMS reply

Goal: Prove the voicemail → AI reply still works for Clean Machine after multi-tenant changes.

From your real phone, call your Clean Machine Twilio number.

Don’t answer, let it roll to voicemail, and leave a real question like:

“Hey, do you have any openings Friday morning? I have a 2018 Camry that needs full interior detail.”

Wait ~30–60s and check:

Do you get the standard missed call SMS?

Do you get a second, more specific SMS referencing the voicemail content (time / service)?

In the admin UI:

Does a conversation thread exist with:

The voicemail transcription

The AI reply

Correct customer phone number

Confirm that thread is clearly labeled as voicemail vs plain SMS.

If you only see the generic missed call SMS and no custom voicemail response, then the voicemail pipeline needs attention.

3. Points welcome landing + booking

(once that drop-in finishes)

In the admin, generate or copy a customer points link that includes a token.
Format should look like:

https://cleanmachinetulsa.com/rewards/welcome?token=XYZ

Paste that link into an incognito window.

Confirm:

Page loads with your branding.

It shows the test customer name (or at least something friendly).

Points balance is visible.

Reward options show up.

Book Now leads to the booking flow AND the tenant/branding stays Clean Machine.

If you already wired this into your apology SMS campaign, send a test SMS to yourself and click the link from the text too.

4. Email “resolution” flow (post support-issue)

Once SP-Support-A is built & email is working:

Force a minor error through the setup/support assistant (e.g. intentionally misconfigure something simple).

Confirm:

The assistant logs a support_issues record.

The admin panel shows it.

Use the admin UI to mark it resolved.

Confirm:

A “we fixed it” email goes to the affected user:

Explains what was broken,

What you changed,

Reassures that it’s working now,

Invites them to reply or chat if anything still feels off.

(We can write that email template once email is confirmed working.)
