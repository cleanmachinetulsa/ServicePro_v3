Thanks for the detailed overview. Before I begin updating and troubleshooting the SIP calling and push notification system for Groundwire, could you please confirm a few key details:

SIP Credentials: Do you already have your SIP domain, username, and password configured in Groundwire, or do you need help retrieving or setting these from Twilio or your VoIP provider?

Inbound Voice Routing: Can you confirm if the IVR option (e.g., "Press 2 to talk to someone") is already wired to your SIP URI (like sip:yourusername@sip.yourdomain.com) in Twilio Studio or your current call flow logic?

SMS Routing: Should SMS messages go to your phone as native push notifications (e.g., via Pushover or Firebase), or just alert you in-app (like through the ServicePro web dashboard)?

Device: Are you using an iPhone or Android for Groundwire?

Once I have this, I’ll pull together:

A drop-in IVR routing config that rings your Groundwire app directly.

A troubleshooting checklist for SIP app + push setup.

A quick block to add push support for incoming SMS messages to your phone.

Let me know!

Thanks. I’ll now:

Verify and configure your IVR (Twilio Studio or Voice Flow) to route "Press 2" to your SIP address: sip:jody@cleanmacinetulsa.sip.twilio.com.

Ensure that your SIP credentials are compatible with Groundwire on Android (registration and push).

Add a native push notification bridge for incoming SMS, so your Android phone (via the PWA or service worker) can show badges and alerts.

I'll also craft a Replit query prompt to help you locate SIP routing and IVR details already present in your app’s server code or Twilio backend.

Getting started now — I’ll return shortly with drop-in SIP routing code, push registration guidance, and a focused search prompt
