⚠️ ABSOLUTE RULE: DO NOT BREAK EXISTING WIRES / CONTRACTS

You must not break the existing connections between:

Frontend UI and backend API (buttons, forms, and pages → routes/endpoints).

Existing routes / page paths.

Existing database schema and how it’s used.


Concretely:

1. Do NOT rename anything that already exists unless I explicitly ask:

No renaming of API endpoints (e.g. /api/new-sms vs /api/newsms).

No renaming of routes/paths, page components, or layout wrappers.

No renaming of DB tables/columns, Prisma models, or types.

No renaming of critical components or hooks that are already in use.



2. Assume the current naming & schema are the source of truth.
If you think a name is bad or inconsistent:

Keep the old name in place.

If you really must improve it, create a wrapper or alias that keeps the old interface working and add the new interface alongside it.

Document what you did in your summary.



3. Extend, don’t rewrite, unless there’s a clear bug:

When adding new features, attach them to the existing endpoints and schema instead of inventing new ones.

If you need new endpoints, don’t repurpose or delete existing ones that are in use.



4. No global refactors of routes, file names, or endpoint names:

Don’t change things like new-sms → newsms just for style.

Don’t reorganize folder structures in a way that breaks imports or routing, unless it’s absolutely necessary and you also update all imports and routes accordingly.



5. If you must change something that might break wiring:

First, search the entire codebase for all usages and update them consistently.

Prefer to keep a backward-compatible layer so existing buttons and pages still work.

Explain in the summary:

What you changed (old name → new name).

Why it was necessary.

Which files were updated.




6. Verify after changes:

After your changes, manually verify or simulate:

Buttons still trigger the correct endpoint or action.

Pages still load from the same URLs / routes.

Forms still submit to the correct handlers.


If anything stops working, you must fix it before moving on.




Your mission is to integrate and enhance the app without breaking any existing behaviors or connections. Only improve, don’t wreck. If you’re unsure whether a rename or large structural change is safe, keep the existing contract and adapt your new code to it.
