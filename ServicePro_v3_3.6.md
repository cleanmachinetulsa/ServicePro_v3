## 12. WHAT YOU DO NEXT (CONCRETE STEPS)

Here’s how to immediately use this:

1. **Add this file to the repo**

   * Path suggestion:
     `docs/MASTER_PLAN_v3.6_SERVICEPRO.md`
   * Commit message:
     `chore: add MASTER_PLAN v3.6 with email, trial telephony, support AI phases`

2. **Tell Replit AI this is canonical**

   Next time you open the Replit agent, start with something like:

   > “Use docs/MASTER_PLAN_v3.6_SERVICEPRO.md as the canonical roadmap. Any new code should follow its phases and constraints, especially multi-tenant rules, email v1, trial telephony, and future support AI.”
