[12/11/2025, 5:59:23 PM] YOU: Gotcha, an interior detail on your Nissan Versa 👍  

Yes, we’re mobile and do come to Tulsa. I can double-check your area, but 74114 is normally within range.  

A couple quick things so I can get you set up:  
1) What’s your name?  
2) Is the interior just dirty/dusty, or are there heavy stains, pet hair, or smoke?
[12/11/2025, 5:59:23 PM] THEM: Interior
[12/11/2025, 6:20:38 PM] YOU: Perfect, thanks for the details!

Yes, you’re in our service area there in midtown.

For your 2010 Nissan Versa interior, our **Interior Detail** runs **$150–250** depending on condition (stains, pet hair, etc.).

A couple quick questions so I can narrow it down and look at times for you:
- Any heavy stains, pet hair, or smoke/odor inside?
- Are you wanting just interior, or interior plus a quick exterior wash too?
[12/11/2025, 6:24:05 PM] THEM: Jody 2010

Our **Interior Detail** runs **$150–250** depending on condition (trash, stains, pet hair, etc.).  

Can you tell me:
- Year of your Nissan Versa  
- How dirty 1–10 (10 = really bad: stains/crumbs/spills)?
[12/11/2025, 6:24:25 PM] THEM: Just interior
[12/11/2025, 6:24:50 PM] YOU: Totally get it, sorry for the runaround there. You're good on the address at 2710 S Hudson Pl, so we're set on that.  

For your Nissan Versa, are you wanting:  
- Interior Detail ($150-250) or

Customer: +19184976112
--------------------------------
[12/11/2025, 4:55:40 PM] YOU: Hey! Thanks for reaching out 🙂

For a 2019 Infiniti QX80 (big SUV), a full interior + exterior detail typically lands here:

- **Full Detail (inside & out):** **$225–300**  
  - Exterior wash, wheels, door jambs, basic bug/tar removal, etc.  
  - Interior vacuum, wipe-down, panels, cupholders, interior windows, basic stain work.

If the interior is **heavier than average** (kids, spills, lots of sand/crumbs, pet hair, etc.), it usually pushes toward the higher end of that range.

If you tell me:
- How dirty the interior is (light / average / heavy)
- Any pet hair or major stains?

…I can give you a tighter estimate. And if you’d like, we can also price some popular add‑ons like **shampooing seats/carpets** or **odor removal**.
[12/11/2025, 4:55:40 PM] THEM: Hi there, I am looking into a detail on a 2019 Infiniti QX80. I would want the interior and exterior done and was hoping you could provide me with an idea of what that would run. Thank you, look forward to hearing back from you!

I’m here for anything car‑cleaning related though 😊  
Do you need help booking a detail or getting a quote for your vehicle?
[12/11/2025, 12:03:58 AM] THEM: So you don't have a personal number right now.
[12/11/2025, 12:04:32 AM] THEM: Detail
[12/11/2025, 12:04:33 AM] YOU: Hey! I’m here 😊  
Just to be sure I’m on the same page—are you wanting to schedule a detail?

If so, can you tell me:
1) What kind of detail you’re thinking (Full Detail, Interior Detail, Premium Wash, etc.)  
2) Year/make/model of the vehicle  
3) Your address (we’re mobile)
[12/11/2025, 12:04:48 AM] YOU: Hey! I’m glad your heart check is looking good 🙌

Sounds like you might be wanting something done on that 2025 Mazda CX-90—are you thinking interior detail, full detail, or maybe ceramic coating for protection?
[12/11/2025, 12:04:48 AM] THEM: 2025 Mazda cx90
[12/11/2025, 12:05:10 AM] YOU: Hey! I’m doing alright, thanks for asking 😊

Interior and ceramic coating sounds perfect.  
What kind of vehicle is it (year/make/model), and where will we be doing the work (address)? Then I’ll check openings for you.
[12/11/2025, 12:05:10 AM] THEM: Interior and ceramic coating
[12/11/2025, 12:05:50 AM] THEM: 2025 Mazda cx90
[12/11/2025, 12:05:51 AM] YOU: Hey! I’m glad your heart’s getting checked out and the PT is moving along. 💪

I saw you mention the 2025 Mazda CX-90 — are you wanting to get it detailed or coated?  
If so, what are you thinking: full detail, interior, or ceramic coating for protection?
[12/11/2025, 12:06:10 AM] THEM: Address 6836 west 34th Pl
Tulsa ok 74107
[12/11/2025, 12:06:11 AM] YOU: Hey! Thanks for sending the address 😊  

Just so I’m on the same page—were you wanting to set up a detail at 6836 W 34th Pl? If so, what kind of service are you thinking? (Full detail, interior, ceramic, etc.)
[12/11/2025, 12:06:57 AM] YOU: Hey! I’m glad your heart’s getting checked out and the wrist PT is moving along ❤️

We can definitely do a Full Detail and Ceramic for you.  

What are you wanting coating-wise:
- 1-year ceramic ($300)  
- or 3-year ceramic ($750)?  

And what are we working on (year/make/model) and where should we come (address)?
[12/11/2025, 12:06:57 AM] THEM: Full detail and ceramic
[12/11/2025, 12:07:40 AM] YOU: Gotcha, ceramic sounds good.  

Is this for a 1-year coating ($300) or 3-year coating ($750)? And what's the vehicle (year/make/model) and address we'd be coming to?
[12/11/2025, 12:07:40 AM] THEM: Ceramic.
[12/11/2025, 12:07:57 AM] THEM: 1 year
[12/11/2025, 12:07:58 AM] YOU: Hey! I’m here to help with your car detailing stuff, not personal calls or medical/relationship things.

You mentioned “1 year” — were you asking about the 1‑year ceramic coating for your vehicle?
[12/11/2025, 12:08:10 AM] YOU: Hey! I'm actually just the texting assistant for Clean Machine Auto Detail, so I don't see the personal stuff you're texting about, just what comes through here.  

I'm here to help with detailing, scheduling, or questions about your vehicle. Do you need to get a detail or ceramic coating set up for your car?
[12/11/2025, 12:08:10 AM] THEM: Yes

[12/11/2025, 12:45:28 AM] YOU: Hey there! Yep, we're fully mobile - we come to your house and do it right in the driveway in Midtown Tulsa, no problem.

For your 2-seater convertible interior, the $105 you mentioned sounds like you're thinking:

- Interior Detail base price: $130  
- Minus $25 = $105

At that $105 level, you'd get:
- Full vacuum (seats, floors, mats, trunk area if accessible)
- Wipe-down of all interior surfaces
- Interior windows cleaned
- Light stain/spot cleaning (since you said it's not bad inside)

A couple things so I can try to get you in:

1) What's your name?  
2) What's the year/make/model of the convertible?

You said you're at 1565 Swan Dr in Midtown and free today - I'll check what we have this afternoon as soon as you send your name and car info.
[12/11/2025, 1:48:56 AM] YOU: Yep, we’re mobile and can come to your house in Midtown and work in the driveway 👍

For your 2‑seater convertible, interior only at $105 would include:
- Thorough vacuum (seats, floors, mats, trunk area if needed)  
- Wipe down & cleaning of interior surfaces  
- Windows inside  
- Light detailing on vents/cupholders, etc.

Since you’re not ready to lock in a time yet, no worries at all. When you’re ready, just text:
1) Your full name  
2) Year/make/model of the car  
3) A day/time that works for you  

And I’ll grab live openings and get a draft appointment set up for you.
[12/11/2025, 1:48:56 AM] THEM: OK, I'll be ready to do this, but not immediately soon

[12/11/2025, 12:22:56 AM] YOU: Nice, those points will come in handy for sure 😄  

What are you leaning toward:
- Interior Detail  
- Full Detail  
- Or something specific (shampoo, pet hair, etc.)?  

And what’s your vehicle year/make/model? I’ll ballpark your total with the 500 pts applied.
[12/11/2025, 12:22:56 AM] THEM: Nice, that 500 pts will definitely help 😄  

What are you thinking:
- Interior Detail (deep inside clean)  
- Full Detail (inside + outside)  
- Or just a specific thing (shampoo, pet hair, etc.)?  

And what’s your vehicle year/make/model? I’ll ballpark your total after your points.
[12/11/2025, 12:23:07 AM] YOU: Nice, those points do come in handy 😄  

Shoot me:
1) What you’re leaning toward (Interior Detail, Full Detail, or other)?
2) Year/make/model of the vehicle  

I’ll ballpark the price for you.
[12/11/2025, 12:23:07 AM] THEM: Love it 😄 those 500 pts will definitely help.

To ballpark it for you, I just need:
1) What service you’re leaning toward (Interior Detail, Full Detail, or something specific)?
2) Your vehicle year/make/model?
[12/11/2025, 12:23:16 AM] THEM: Love it 😄 those “points” are basically your savings on future details.

Quick stuff I need from you:
1) Which service are you thinking? (Interior Detail, Full Detail, or something else?)
2) Year/make/model of your vehicle?

I’ll give you a price range and we can go from there.
[12/11/2025, 12:23:17 AM] YOU: Nice, thanks for sticking with me 😄  

Let’s start fresh so I can actually help you book or price something out:

1) Which service are you thinking? (Interior Detail, Full Detail, Premium Wash, etc.)  
2) What’s the year/make/model of your vehicle?  

Once I have that, I’ll give you a solid price range and we can look at openings if you’d like.
[12/11/2025, 12:23:27 AM] YOU: Perfect, that’s exactly what I’d ask. 😊

1) The service you want  
2) Your year/make/model  

Then I’ll give you a price range and check openings.

[12/9/2025, 8:36:34 PM] YOU: Hey Doug I wasn't sure if my new phone system is working correctly so I messaged you through my personal phone just to be sure. Thanks!
[12/10/2025, 12:11:46 AM] THEM: Got it! My daughter's car is a  2014 Toyota Prius.  What will you charge to detail it?
[12/10/2025, 12:11:47 AM] YOU: Nice gift idea for her Prius!

For a 2014 Toyota Prius, pricing would be:
- Full Detail: $225-300 (inside & out, best for a full refresh)
- Interior Detail only: $150-250
- Premium Wash only: $75+

Range depends on condition (pet hair, heavy stains, etc.).  
Is her interior pretty average, or is it heavily soiled?
[12/10/2025, 12:13:39 AM] YOU: Perfect, thanks for confirming.

For an average-condition 2014 Prius, you're likely in the lower end of the ranges:

- Full Detail (inside & out): about $225-250  
- Interior Detail only: about $150-175  

Since this is a Christmas gift, do you want:
1) Full Detail (inside & out), or  
2) Interior only?

Also, are you wanting this done before Christmas, or right after the holiday?
[12/10/2025, 12:13:39 AM] THEM: I would say average.
[12/10/2025, 12:15:18 AM] YOU: Sounds good, that week usually works well.

Once you check with her, I'll just need:
1) Your name  
2) Her preferred day/time that week  
3) Service choice: Full Detail or Interior only  
4) Service address  

Then I can draft the appointment and send it for review.
[12/10/2025, 12:15:18 AM] THEM: I'll have to check with her, but probably the week between Christmas and New Years Day.
